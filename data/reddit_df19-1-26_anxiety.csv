How do you fall asleep quickly when you are having anxiety,"My head is noisy and my heart feels like im running. I want to sleep early but can’t because of the reason mentioned. 
Currently this is my bedtime routine 
Lights off, have something on my laptop or phone (via earphones) playing something sometimes its like a standup show or podcast but most of the time im awake till the show ends. And sometimes I can’t sleep at all, i’ll just need on YouTube or netflix just watching something then I realise its 2 am. I have to have something on cause just to make me not focus on my noisy head. 

What is ur trick to falling asleep quickly?",1580094386.0,1.0,0
Long post....just having a tough time,"The last couple months have been rough. I was on Paxil for over 20 years and recently weaned myself off of it...very carefully but it still sucked....because I felt like I needed to see who the ""real"" me is and if I could function without it. My last dose was Nov 26. Since then I have been regressing into depression and anxiety again to the point where it's getting difficult for me to leave my house for anything but work which is also a struggle.  I really dont want to go back on meds but now I'm fearful that I cant function without them and I just want to find what it is that's broken inside me and fix it without being dependent on a pill. I have tried counseling off and on but I never feel like theres time to get to the root of anything.  One huge part of my anxiety has to do with car travel and I don't know why and it sucks because all but one of my kids live far away and I want to be able to travel and go see them and my grandkids!! I dont have a problem flying but I live several hours from the nearest airport and getting there is a nightmare for me. I have accomplished it in the past and always been glad...but also terrified of the next time and how hard and painful it is. I just feel weak and pathetic for being like this too because deep down I know its irrational but I cant stop it!!  And I feel like I'm having a pity party writing this....but it's more just extreme frustration.  Thanks for listening if you got through this long post....it is helpful to know there are other people who fight this battle.",1580094264.0,1.0,0
IS anyone else scared to get mentally better?,"I've come to the conclusion that I am scared of helping myself or doing anything to make myself get better. I've always suffered from anxiety since childhood and I almost feel comfortable having all this anxiety in me. Anxiety is kind of like a blanket or a cushion to protect me from the real world.  I recently started seeing a therapist and I'm kind of scared to continue with therapy and modifying my behavior. The idea of not having any anxiety itself gives me anxiety. Honestly I don't understand myself sometimes.  It's like I can't see myself functioning normally. It kind of feels like, if I get better, will this all there be in life?",1580093616.0,1.0,2
A Poem about Anxiety,"Hi, so my school has a writing competition every year, and I decided to write a poem about how I experience my anxiety.  Thought I would share to this community, maybe someone else here could relate?  Any comments/criticism welcome.

 

**Clockwork**

The succession of succinct clicks follow

each other as gears twist, winding up my

Darkness tight like a spring… or a coil?

I don’t know

what makes my thoughts sharper, harsh but on beat

to the incessant ticking that’s tickling

my mind won’t stop can’t stop *stop* *this now*.

Be slow now, steady, a needle strikes seconds

to trace the perfect arcs, form the circle

form its face, the blank face, white face austere

hide the rough tumultuousness that lies

behind the smooth face a snarling, mean thing

Enmeshed within tangled twists of metal

patiently lurking, waiting, for the time

its complex cage can control it no more

waiting for the slip, the *snap* of a chain

that would break the rhythm that has become

the beat of the heart of my tenuous mind",1580093598.0,1.0,0
"I just had a panic attack trying to do an online interview(recorded and sent in not an actual meeting). All I could think about was how stupid I looked and how quiet it was, every word I tried to get out was a stutter. I couldn’t even make it past the practice questions. I just felt like puking.","I plan on on figuring out ways to make myself more comfortable and prepared. Has anyone experienced this, or am I just a big baby?

"Long post, but need support/words of encouragement.","So, this is going to be long but I would really super appreciate the help. 

I've always had anxiety, just like anyone else. But last year around February, my parents decided they wanted to separate. I didn't really deal with it at the time because I lived in OH and they lived in IL so I figured out of sight out of mind I guess. Well that led to my mom and brother moving in with me bc they didn't really know where to go. It didn't really work out bc my mom was just really overbearing but I pushed thru it. During this time, I found out that my grandma had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and I took it pretty hard. All at the same time I was trying to plan my wedding with my now husband. So in May, I had my first panic attack. I had no idea what was wrong with me but it was so scary. From that point on, it never stopped. Everyday I felt out of my body, I couldn't drink anymore, I couldn't drive, I even quit three jobs bc it was so much. I had to tell my mom that I couldn't live with her anymore bc she was contributing to my anxiety. In August, I got married and it was wonderful. In October I found out I was pregnant. At this point, we decided that we wanted to move to IL to raise the baby closer to family. So we did in November. December 2nd, I found out that we had lost the baby and two weeks later I had a D&C at 12 weeks. I was obviously devastated and my anxiety was just at the worst. I was constantly depersonalized, dizzy all the time, I couldn't do anything. Mind you, this whole time I was living in a house with 7 people and my husband and I didn't even have our own bed. We slept on a twin size pull out couch almost every night. So anyways, I decided enough was enough and I went to the doctor and was put on Lexapro 5mg. I felt a significant difference within the first week. I do still have my days where I am anxious but I will take a 0.5mg of valium if I need it. So, about a month ago we told my family that we were moving back to OH bc it is best for us mentally, and financially. We moved yesterday and it's been hard. I miss my family and my anxiety has just been crazy. I have felt dizzy all day, which my doctor says is from stress. I know that it is an adjustment but I guess I just need some kind words of encouragement. I'm being patient with my medication but all I want is to just feel like me again.",1580093425.0,1.0,0
Does anyone else feel anxious after going out?,"Today I hung out with a friend I haven't seen in a while and I had a good time. We walked by the water front and went out to eat. I tried to tell myself that it is possible to go out, have fun, and not suffer reprocussions later. Usually afterwards I'll feel anxious or get a bad stomach ache. But now that I'm home... I feel off. Almost kind of dissociative like. Anyone else ever go through this?",1580093410.0,1.0,0
Doubting my own mind,"Idk if this counts as anxiety, but sometimes I feel like I’m downplaying my problems in my mind because I feel like I’m just faking my problems in my head.

Health anxiety makes me go insane,"It all started when I looked up all the things that could go wrong after you stop drinking. I used to drink every night starting September 2019, which lasted until November 2020 when I started throwing up because I drank so much. Since then I have only drank three times in small amounts because my anxiety won’t let me drink more (thank god). After I started throwing up I searched the internet for every little thing that could happen to me, which in turn made me an anxious mess that thought he was going to die. I eventually got over this phase and moved on to the next one which was based on my constant high heart rate. Now I’m always concerned that I have a heart issue and that’s what is going to end my life. I often have chest and arm pain but I’m not sure if that’s just me overthinking it or not. I ended up going to the hospital and they did an ECG which was fine also but that wasn’t enough to convince me for more than a few hours that I was okay. I still get the pain in my chest and arms and need a method to keep my mind somewhere else other than my health.",1580092036.0,1.0,0
So overwelmed and cant calm down,"I have a lot of issues going on at once and I  having a meltdown.  I have bills piled up causing an immense amount of financial strain.  My boss at work is absolutely awful to me and my coworkers, enough that it is impossible to let it all roll off of my back.  Hes such a jerk, hes had full store employee walk outs in the past but it didnt phase him.  
Also, my 3 year old is having behavior issues.  She hits and doesnt listen and is attached at my hip and it is too much for me.  I have 4 kids total and a full time job and I am exhausted.  I am so overwelmed right now.  

At this moment, I am laying in my hallway in the dark listening to my 3 year old om her bed screaming for me, my 7 year old in my bed whining that she cant sleep due to the screaming, im exhausted from a lof of stress at work this last week and a half, my laundry is piled up, house a mess.

So I’m 17 and live in the uk I moved from down by Bristol/Birmingham to Manchester and well It’s going good .But my anxiety is back .

Through school I was bullied bad and I was moving from between my mum and dads house because they were divorced. I had also been sexually harassed at my job when I was 15 ,my life was a mess let’s just say . I have never dated before my current boyfriend . I wasn’t a normal kid , I didn’t like leaving the house or being in social situations , I hated being in crowded areas and was very self conscious .Through our school I was very tall and skinny about 5.10 in year 9/10  but now I’ve put weight on I’m feeling worse about my self . This is just a bit of background for you . 

Anyway I moved up here too be with my boyfriend we met over Xbox he is the sweetest thing going , he has helped me massively . When I moved I dropped all my friends which at the time didn’t bother me and I dropped work and my family( my family love him and they are happy for me.) There’s a problem tho I can’t leave the house ! I do leave for the doctors etc but I live in Manchester it’s crowded busy and I just feel to much anxiety about people to leave the house anymore . I work from home 3 days a week and it’s like a cycle of anxiety I can’t get a job out the house because my anxiety but that means I feel horrible because I haven’t left the house in weeks . To top that all off I have no friends and now I could really Do with some . I’m so lonely and have no one to talk to and it’s so hard to explain . I do play Xbox all the time but have no one to play it with apart from my boyfriend .Another thing I have anxiety about going anywhere on my own or being on my own anywhere as I was once raped and I fear that . I fear it could happen again or something worse . Yes I’m still with my boyfriend and we’ve been together since last June and I moved up here in October . I’m sorry this is a mess I have no excuse I’m just bad a writing long paragraphs 😂😳) I’m just confused and scared and need some advice .  


Btw my boyfriend is so nice about my anxiety and being depressed as he use to have depression . I just feel bad as he’s too good for me and I shouldn’t put my issues on him . Also we live with his parents and they don’t know about my anxiety which makes this worse for me .Yet again I’m sorry this is one messy post 🥺.",1580073914.0,1.0,0
Does Anyone Ever Experience Anxiety Over Their Cooking Skills?,"I had my family out to my house yesterday. There was 13 people, including myself, my husband, & our daughter. I made chili & cheeseburger soup. I made the cheeseburger soup for the same crowd last year and they loved it. This year, it didn’t turn out quite the same. I had to add more liquid to it to get the potatoes to cook. That made it too thin. Everyone said it tasted great, but my nephew (who can be a picky eater) and my cousin’s wife didn’t eat it. I’m focusing more on those two than on the people who said it was great. 

Note: I myself didn’t taste either because they had meat in them. I am vegan. Makes it a little more difficult to cook for others and not be able to taste it for myself. I trust my husband & daughter’s opinion (especially my kid - she won’t BS me). She said it was fantastic and had the one bowl that was leftover for dinner last night. I had made a huge pot of it and my family basically ate it all.",1580090496.0,1.0,0

I feel like I’m going to push my girlfriend too far and ruin our relationship,"To start off we have been together nearly 3 years in march and i warned her about my anxiety, it was a bad first year i was clingy and a nervous wreck i used to hate using messenger because would always check to see if she went online or if she checked it that kind of stuff it was an annoying year but she was great through it all and helped me every step. 

We have hit loads of bumps along the way but a-lot of the time my anxiety turns into anger, she doesn’t make me angry its just a lot of things that are the cause for the stuff in my head i just get frustrated about.

Recently I’ve been tossing and turning not being able to sleep. just constantly worrying that some day she’ll just have enough with it and give up on me which i would understand if she did i dont deserve somebody that perfect. she should be with someone that doesn’t hold her down with all this baggage..

Can’t get yelled at without crying/almost crying,"So this is a thing that’s been going on as long as I can remember, and it’s why I HATE asking for things, be it help at a store or an extra napkin or whatever it may be, because I’m just irrationally afraid that whoever it is will yell at me. 

Today I was at my college dining hall and there’s a station where they have stuff behind glass, and you tell the worker which one you want and they’ll put it in the oven for you (lasagna, fish, etc.). In my opinion they’re a bit understaffed here bc they have one person working this station as well as getting the pizzas in and out of the oven. I always feel bad for the person working there bc it seems like a lot to do, so I always stand there and wait for them to look up/notice me/be done with the task at hand because I know they’re busy. I was waiting there today as the worker took out a couple pizzas and cut them, then still waiting as she cleaned/organized some of the platters because again, I figured she’d look up when she was ready to take my order. She then looked up and yelled at me, saying if I had said “hi how are you” she’d stop doing what she was doing and take my order, instead of me just standing there looking at her (she imitated the way I guess I looked, watching her/surveying, although I hope I did not look that judgmental, as I always work hard to keep my face neutral and work against RBF). I stuttered out an apology and it took all of my strength to resist the urge to just run off to another station, and then when she put my lasagna in the oven I hid behind a pole to wait bc there were tears pricking at my eyes and I just knew if she looked at me again I’d lose it. And I get it, the last thing I’d want to be doing all day is standing by a hot oven catering to college students, and I try to tell myself it’s nothing personal, but that doesn’t stop the tears. 

I’m so embarrassed about this quality in myself. As I write, I’m back in my dorm, crying all the tears I held in earlier. I had plans to play a board game tonight but now I just can’t bc my mood is ruined and I’m so embarrassed at how pathetic I am that I literally burst into tears over something like this.",1580089317.0,1.0,2

Rumination.....,"Hey, so this is my first post on here. I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but I honestly thought it was normal. As I've gotten older, I'm realizing that it really isn't normal. I have never been formally diagnosed, but I have had 3 different doctors try to prescribe me anti anxiety medicine within 10 minutes of meeting me.... if that tells you anything. (Medical anxiety... anyone else???)

Anyways, I want to talk about rumination. I dread social interactions. The funny thing is, I'm usually okay while the social interaction is happening. I might feel a little anxious, but I can usually manage it. For me, it's afterwards. When I'm home and trying to sleep I run through those conversations/interactions over in my head and pick apart every stupid thing I said/did. Sometimes I still do it years after the event took place depending on how badly I feel that I messed up. 

I honestly thought everyone did this... apparently not. I now dread interacting with people and feel anxious beforehand because I know that the rumination is going to come afterwards. Can anyone else relate? Has anyone figured out any coping strategies for it???",1580088865.0,0.99,2

I have some questions about noting.,"I’m trying the noting technique. Which is basically when you notice your caught up in thoughts or feelings, you bring your attention back to what you’re doing, or your breath.

But I have a few questions I hope you guys could answer:

Are there ANY thoughts or feelings I SHOULD engage with, such as:

- Nice thoughts and feelings?
- Thoughts or feelings that bring attention to something ""scary"", yet beneficial that I’m avoiding?

Will I miss out on positives in life by never thinking of thoughts, feelings, the past, and the future?

And am I still human acting like this? Or are these things unnecessary? And only right NOW matters?

I’m anxious that if I let go of acting on thoughts or feelings I’ll become unsafe. I feel I have to worry about things to deal with them properly. I even feel I have to think about anxiety so I discover a solution to finally beat it. It feels like it’s my responsibility and duty to think about how to get over it. 

Is this something I’ll need to do for life? Or just now?

Memories seem to form a lot of my NOW, because I’m reminded of things I’ve done in the past in the places I’m in now. Should I ignore these, as they blend between the past and THE NOW?

Medication questions,"Hi! I’ve been on 50mg Zoloft for almost 4 months now and it helps with my anxiety pretty well. However I do notice that it makes me incredibly tired all the time and just numb to everything emotionally.

Something else I want think about trying is xanax. I’m worried that the doctors will think I’m trying to get a prescription to abuse it but I also have documented anxiety so maybe not? I like the idea of not having to take something everyday. I like the idea of being able to manage my anxiety on my own but if I can’t just being able to have something to calm me down.

Getting back on your feet while struggling with anxiety is not impossible.,"Hello, um this is my first time posting on reddit so bear with me. Also sorry for the bad format. 

(EDIT:  just posting this gave me an actual anxiety attack since I rarely even like to post about such things and I'm constantly terrified of being judged by strangers) 

I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for most of my life. Last year I was diagnosed with PTSD due to going through traumatic experiences.

At the end of 2019 I entered college to get certified for a certain job field I'm interested in entering, since I started that class, steadily I have been learning more and more skills on how to combat my anxiety. Of course I had some really bad days and I had triggers and attacks, but slowly but surely it's getting easier. 
I found that entering school was one of the best things for me, that plus doing different types of therapy and exercises to as well. 
 
I'm going to graduate later this year, and I've got a positive feeling that I can finally be able to rope my anxiety under control. 

My point for this post is, it's not impossible. It's hard as hell, I know. Trust me I have been there, I am still dealing with it, there will always be those days where everything is just a nightmare, but in the end I am in charge of my anxiety, and it is not in charge of me. 
You can do it, take your time. Care for yourself, even if it takes a while, even if it's hard and it feels impossible, don't stop fighting to get over the anxiety that has a hold on you. 

One last thing, find people who you can trust to support you.",1580086143.0,1.0,0
I can’t take positive responses,"This mainly happens when I make music, but basically, whenever I get a positive response from someone like “nice job” or “this is good”, I take it the same way I do with negative responses. I don’t feel proud of myself. It’s not that I don’t believe them, I honestly don’t know if I do or don’t, but it’s just a negative feeling and my mind doesn’t comprehend that it’s a positive message. The only explanation I can think of is that it’s because the people who bullied me years back would pretend to support me, but then hurt me right after. I guess my brain is just expecting that blow after, and while it’s been a while since then, it still affects me. While my negative thoughts don’t come at me like they used to, I still get that negative feeling associated with it. I’d appreciate some help to rewire my brain or get it out of this “habbit”.

I don't feel normal?,"I've always had severe social anxiety, but over the past few years, it's become increasingly difficult for me to make friends.

I feel like an alien, in a way. I can't always laugh when I'm supposed to and it's hard for me to feel comfortable or connected to anyone aside from my boyfriend. Is this a normal symptom of anxiety?

Has anybody ever dealt with movies-related anxiety?,"Ever since I was a child, dealing with the first bouts of OCD and Anxiety disorders, I’ve had huge trouble managing panic responses to certain kinds of movies.
Above all, I literally couldn’t handle spotting a vhs/dvd cover of the Child’s Play movies or Goosebumps’ Slappy, without feeling an absurd rush of panic coming over me. I had never seen a single second of those things, but the mere sight of Chucky’s face would just shut me down, with my heart beating fast and a lingering sensation of fear and anxiety following all day long. 
Sometimes, I would be able to open up about what I had seen with my parents and I would calm down, but only after taking about it. Otherwise, it was just me and my imagination. I would literally obsess about movies and books I was scared about; each time running away from the mere mention of them, but constantly ruminating and wondering just how terrible those things were. 
When I did finally see the entirety of Child’s Play series, years and years later, I simply thought they were fun movies, years away from the terrifying horrors I had imagined in my childhood head.

This pattern however returned around the time I was 12. I was already into horror movie around that time and I had gone seeing Terry Gilliam’s The Brothers Grimm (one of my favorite directors now) but one particular scene (The Gingerbread Man, for those who have seen it) completely freaked me out and I ran crying to the bathroom, followed by that same gripping lack of breath and brain screams I had experienced during my childhood. I did manage to return into the theater, but it took me years to actually watch that scene.

And, years later, I literally escaped from a showing of Under The Skin, which was a definite first for me, cause at that point I felt utterly defeated; something like Fear had won over. Same thing happened during Hereditary (Which probably gave me the worst fight or flight reaction of my life) and, last night, from Color Out Of Space. 

I know my anxiety issues are far bigger than a simple distaste for creepy AF horror movies and I know I can definitely live without needing to face every single piece of entertainment that causes me distress, but since I only ever get these kinds of reactions with certain movies (real life panic reactions have a different taste, I don’t how to explain it) I was wondering if anybody has ever experienced the same.",1580083670.0,1.0,0
Worst panic attack so far. thought I was going to die last night.,"I was woken up around 2:30 am by my dog scratching to be let out. I stood up and started walking to the back door when suddenly I felt hot and my heart started to race. I felt a panic attack coming on so I did what I usually do at home, I sat in the bathroom to try and calm down. My heart just keep beating faster and no matter what I did, I couldn’t get it to calm down in the slightest.

I splashed cold water on my face, I tried breathing exercises as I felt like my body was on fire. I completely stripped down to try and cool myself off but at this point I was convinced something was terribly wrong with my heart. I didn’t have any shortness of breath or chest pain but my heart was just beating so insanely fast. After about 20 minutes in the bathroom, I walked to my mom’s bedroom door and told her I think I needed to go to the hospital. 

She had me lay down on her bed and tried to calm me down because she is well aware of my panic attacks. After about 5 minutes my heart rate started to return to normal. I spent the rest of the night having “aftershocks” of anxiety and on and off whole body shakes until my benzodiazepines finally kicked in and I fell asleep.

I feel like I’m dying [TRIGGER WARNING],"***In this post, I will be talking about symptoms I have had during panic attacks and in my general day to day anxiety that might be triggering to some***


Hello, 

This is going to be a longer post, but I don’t know where else to turn. 

I have been suffering from anxiety for as long as I can remember (about 7th grade, I am now 23). I used to also have severe depression, but have since gotten to a point where I no longer consider it to be anything more than mild at most. In fact, my anxiety seemed to be doing a lot better throughout my college career too. I got engaged my senior year and things seemed really good. 

But then, I graduated and moved back home while searching for a career in may of 2019. Soon after, I was sitting at my desk one night when all of the sudden I felt a strange sensation in my back, followed by numbness and tingling all over my body and severe fear set in. I started breathing heavy and trembling and thought I was about to die. It felt like I was out of my body, and watching through a tv screen or something. One trip to the hospital later, it was determined I had a panic attack. Unfortunately, I continued to have one-sometimes even two or three-almost every day for about the next month and a half with all the same symptoms. During this time, I sought out medication from my doctor, as he diagnosed me with panic disorder, but I had a severe reaction and had to stop. 

I started seeing a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapist in August, as I was still having debilitating panic attacks. She helped me learn a lot of techniques to keep myself calm, and eventually the frequency of the attacks went down to the point where I haven’t had more than 2-3 in the past few months. However, I have just moved to a new city to live with my fiance and continue to look for work, and have noticed certain things. My heart races all the time, I have headaches, I always feel like I’m going to pass out, I feel sick to my stomach and just generally unwell and I’m always nervous or dreadful that something is seriously wrong with me or that I have some illness. I have been to the doctor more than once (not since these newer symptoms or moving) and every time he has said that I am generally healthy.

I can’t afford to go to the doctor every time I think something is wrong, as I think it just feeds my anxiety. However, I can’t keep living like this, as it is affecting my happiness and I want to be able to enjoy this new city with my fiancé. I feel like my body is utterly convinced that I am on the verge of death, and while my techniques from CBT help, part of me is beginning to question if I am or not. 

Has anyone else experienced these kinds of symptoms? Should I be concerned? And if not, does anyone have any suggestions to things that help them stay grounded and deter these anxious/panicky feelings? If you made it to the end of this, thank you.",1580082957.0,1.0,1

Anxiety as a medical student,"I want to briefly mentioned the my personal problems with anxiety. Not only do I have some pretty intense social anxiety (which is quite obviously bad in terms of dealing with patients) but I have some some quite severe health anxiety. I know, you are asking yourself ""why the fuck is this guy a medical student""

No body knows about the anxiety that I have. I never talk about it. With anyone. Learning about some diseases and their symptoms makes me think I have that disease in a very real way. I literally get the symptoms exactly how they would show up in a textbook. One by one, I recall the symptoms associated with a illness, and then get them. For example, I am currently thinking I have botulism. Botulism is incredibly rare, I do not have botulism. But i am getting the symptoms of botulism because I learned about that disease a month or two ago and I am having anxiety about the fact that I left food in my slow cooker for longer than intended.

Talking problems derived from anxiety?,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the right section to ask for this. I'm 24 and a problem is really affecting my daily life. I have been an anxious person till my 20 more or less. At that age I decided to confide in a therapist that really changed my life. After one year of therapy I improved myself so much about a lot of aspects of my life. I had social anxiety problems (nothing serious anyway) but then my life literally got better. My therapist told me that even after therapy I could have had bad sporadics times of sadness and anxiety and I'm learning to deal with it. Now this is my problem, I'm getting comfortable with dealing anxiety, but there is an aspect of myself that isn't make me living. Sometimes, mostly when I experience anxiety, I have talking problems. It's hard to explain, I'm just not able to articulate some words, it happens a lot of time that I can't introduce myself to someone because I can't say my name, I have kind of obstacle that doesn't let me talking. It happens with others words too, sometimes I can't even go buying something because of difficult to talking with clerk. This is not a problem of vocal articulation or something like that because when I was younger I saw a speech therapist but I had absolutely no problems. I'm perfectly able to talk well, I like reading when I'm alone and when I do I read loudly with no problems. I think it's just related to anxiety, but I don't know why it affects my talking.

Life's fucked up,"Reposting this here as I was advised u guys maybe can help :
So this needs a little back story, excuse any typo bcs English isn't my first language.
Both my mom and dad were addicted to alcohol. My mom died 3 years ago because of this, after 3 years of fighting for her and being in and out of hospitals.
My relationship with my dad was never quite right, because he was out of The country most of The Time working on a Ship. The fail of their marriage was a mix between 2 absolutely different personalities and the fact that they were both drunk 90% of The Time they spent together. Mom was pretty chill, but dad really liked to scream. There was never any phisycal abuse but the emotional abuse was pretty rough. We even called the cops to get my dad to chill like a hundred of Times thus resulting in some pretty nasty tickets that he still has to pay for. At the Time my mom died we had an restraining order against my dad and they were freshly divorced. I also have a Sister who is 4 and a half years younger. We were also staying with my maternal grandpa so we just continued to stay with him. I patched up my relationship with my dad. But my Sister left and another family got custody over her ( we still speak but not very much as I m considered a bad influence on her).
So, I was really close with both my mom and my Sister and I have neither one anymore. I also struggled with some really bad panic atacks that only my mom could calm down so u can guess how well this went.
I am now living with my maternal grandpa  ( who pays for everything including me and my dad) (my dad does not have a job) and my dad. The thing is my grandpa who is my Best friend is also 87 years old. My dad still drinks a lot and is pretty much the same only I have to Carry this alone. Not even my closest friends know much about this as I m a private person and I rlly Don t like People to Pity me. Therapy doesn t work for my dad and the only thing that can make him quit alcohol is himself, but being in the devastating depression he s in I don't see an END to that. I'm 17.
I'm a pretty strong person and I ve managed my anxiety attacks, I don't Take any pills to calm me down or anything but the thing that really gets me is that I think I have some serious attachament issues, like I can't leave the house without thinking smth gonna happen to my dad or my grandpa. I kind of managed this too bcs I am a really spiritual person and have found much relief in that but the fact that I don t really speak to anyone still kills me and random mild panic attacks still emerge. I don t have problems making friends or anything I LOVE People and being around them but I can rarely put myself in a place mentally where I can freely engage in conversations and I really fear this Will turn into a nasty depression for me to which for The life of mine I can t afford bcs I have to look after my dad and his mental health ( he also has heart problems) 
I don t even know if this is a rant or anything but like ANY advice on overcoming this is welcomed.

Short-Term Situational Anxiety?,"Hello all. Sorry if I’m in the wrong place but I need a place to start...

I’m going through an incredibly stressful time in my life at the moment. Long story short, in about 4 weeks we will have a day in court and it will all be sorted out at that point. I’m keeping that firmly fixed in my mind that this is a temporary problem and will all be resolved in the next four weeks. 

But, I’m having real issues dealing with it in the meantime. I don’t think there is anything clinically “wrong” with me, hence I have not yet gone to see my GP, but due to the stress of the court case and finances and work etc (all linked), I’m having regular bouts where I cry uncontrollably, or panic feelings where I start to feel trapped and afraid. I’m also horribly absentminded and forgetful, not sleeping (approx 3 hours a night for 2 weeks) and feeling generally out of control. 

Please can anyone help? Would my GP even be able to prescribe anything to get me to wind down and relax in the meantime or do I just have to soldier on knowing it will all be over in a month? Is there something else I can do to make it bearable in the meantime?

I have tried (with no or limited success) eating healthy, no caffeine and sugar, alcohol, no alcohol, being highly physically active (Manual labour job, lots of swimming and walking every day), deep breathing exercises and meditation, self medicating with marijuana, alcohol, codeine, and mindfulness exercises. All of which make either no difference or only help briefly.

Has one traumatic experience created bad anxiety for anyone?,"Hey guys, I apologize for the length of this post but I’d like to go into detail and would appreciate if someone would be able to read through all of this. The main question of this post is, has anyone gone through a traumatic experience that has caused anxiety for themselves and you just can’t seem to get past it? I’ll explain my story

In early July 2019, I fell out of a moving vehicle going around 15 mph. Yes.. I know I’m an idiot but there’s nothing I can do now about it besides learn from my severely stupid mistake. I landed on the right side of my body and rolled around a couple times. Fortunately, I did not hit my head (that I can recall, I was drunk).  A couple days after the fall, I started experiencing severe back and neck pain. The pain was all near my spine; cervical thoracic and lumbar. I decided to see a doctor and explained I fell out of a tree. Very silly on my part to not explain the actual scenario but I was so embarrassed. He decided for me to seek Physical Therapy.

Physical Therapy helped but then I had a month of no insurance in August. Around the last day of PT, I started feeling this pain on the side of my neck, it was near the right side of my neck and also toward the front right side. I had no health insurance for August because the transition of college to work caused a layover, so I could not seek any medical help for the whole month under coverage, everything would have to be out of pocket. This was the WORST month of my life. The pain I was experiencing was still terrible, and I convinced myself that I had some sort of nerve issue or herniated disc. I would wake up every night with pain and the thought that I may not be able to move my legs if this goes untreated. This is where my anxiety started kicking in badly, the thought of a severe issue with my back/neck but not being able to afford an MRI without health insurance. I sometimes smoke weed, and my anxiety even worsened under the influence. A couple of the times I was high I would get this pain in my throat/front of the neck that made me worry that this could have been caused by the fall, very similar to the area of which I started experiencing side neck pain on the last day of Physical Therapy. I would think that my throat was closing which terrified me, I stopped smoking weed until further notice.

Luckily, I made it to September and convinced my doctor I needed MRI’s. He sent me for a complete spinal scan; brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. All results came back negative which was great, and I could finally put my mind to ease that I sustained some sort of nerve damage or a spinal fracture. I now knew that my pain was musculoskeletal, and I started physical therapy again.

Fast forward to present day, and physically I feel great. I still get neck and back stiffness, but for the most part they feel fine. My stiffness could easily come from now sitting 40 hours a week with an office job. I’m back to working out (carefully of course) and participate in cardio workouts like running or biking. 

However, mentally, I still feel off. Ever since that fall occurred, I have not felt like myself. Pretty much every time I get nervous or anxious, I attribute my problems to that fall. It seems I can’t shake off the fall memory in my head. I still get that neck pain in the side of my neck, the pain I had on the last day of my physical therapy. This pain still leads me to that throat closing sensation, and in addition to that, I noticed a bump on the right side of my neck. I decided to seek another doctor for this issue, and he sent me for a blood test for my thyroid, a CDC blood test (detect for lymphoma), and an ultrasound to detect any thyroid issues. Additionally, I had a laryngoscopy performed through my nose to look down my throat, and all these results came back negative. My primary care physician said this could be from anxiety, but I still feel like something is wrong.

So, what I’m currently dealing with is this throat closing sensation, and the anxiety from this bump on my neck. The tests for these present issues came back negative, but I still worry/feel that something is wrong, and I still relate all of this to my fall, but I’ve been told repeatedly that there’s nothing to worry about. I can’t get rid of this anxiety and it’s affecting my social life, all I want to do is be home where I feel safe in case something bad ever happened I could get to the hospital quickly. I haven’t felt like myself really. Additionally, when I do smoke weed sometimes again, I still feel this throat issue and it makes me wonder if there’s some underlying issue I haven’t discovered yet.

My question to anyone who took the time to read this is, have you ever had one traumatic experience that started your anxiety? Have you found a way to combat your anxiety from your situation? Has your situation improved since your experience?

Any feedback from my story would be greatly appreciated, and please feel free to share your story too. I truly thank anyone who has taken the time to read this",1580076351.0,1.0,7
Every time I try to do something with my anxiety something happen,"This morning my ex call me after 2 months of trying to be together and falling. We just couldn’t do it anymore and left things forever a month ago, but today she call me and told me that she wanted to be with me again but since we broke up things have been horrible for me.

I have been in a crisis and had one suicide attempt, everyday I have at least 2 panic attacks and all because I felt so guilty for everything. I started to go to a psychiatrist and a psychologist, and I felt a little better but today when she told me that se wanted to be with me again, I couldn’t, I just told her that I need some time on my own, I just need to try to be better with the situation. After that she told me that it’s not when I want and she wasn’t  going to be there when I felt better... it was a goodbye forever. 

When we broke up she asked for the same things and I gave her all the time she needed but she treated me like shit. I constantly tried to recover the relationship and showed her how much I cared, but she react just the way I did. I don’t understand why she can do those things but when I do I’m horrible and don’t love her.

I feel so guilty about this decision but I also believe it was for the best. I feel really bad and can’t stop crying, I miss her but I just can’t do this anymore, I don’t feel good about myself and all I want right now is die.

I needed to get this out of my chest, I’m feeling like I’m losing this fight and I just can’t do this anymore.

As much as we all worry about our health as well as some existential dread, Heart failure is the cause of death for 100% of humans ever. As long as our heart is beating, we are alive, unconscious or not. If you pass out, your heart will beat on, you will wake up and be alive. You have to have a legitimate heart problem or issue to just drop dead. Obviously physical tragedies occur(car crash, falling off a building, etc), but if your heart is healthy, you are safe. And odds are, it is healthy. If you have a panic attack and pass out, you do not die. You pass out and wake up. If you think you’re having trouble breathing and you end up passing out, odds are your heart will beat on, and if your heart beats on you’re alive. In fact, even if it stops beating for a few minutes, you still aren’t dead. Take care of your heart and don’t worry, because as long as it’s beating you cannot die.",1580075877.0,0.83,16
"For Anyone With Driving Phobia, Fear of Heights, or Even Just Generalized Anxiety","Have spent 30-years struggling with dizziness while driving in freeway left lanes, middle lanes, and especially on huge freeways that require you to merge left. Hypnosis didn't help much, and produced some weird results. Calming herbs helped, but did not fix the problem. Yesterday I discovered something that (knock on wood) seems to make a HUGE difference.

Metaphor: When I was a kid in elementary school, all the other kids freely jumped from the playground's wooden platforms onto a tire bridge suspended in between. I could not do it, for fear of falling through the holes! Finally one day after school I tried it when no one was looking. I stared right at the hole I wanted to avoid and, poof, through the hole I went! How does this relate to driving anxiety and fear of heights?

Yesterday I realized that the more I fear getting dizzy on the freeway, the harder I try to focus ahead of me and not see all the cars on both sides. Except, of course, being a responsible driver I need to look all around. So what I do is look from side to side, in the rearview mirrors, etc. using both of my eyes - which makes my eyes keep darting back and forth. In other words, when anxious, I have not been using my peripheral vision!!

Related topic: I have a lot of trouble crossing logs while backpacking, because my vision gets all blurry when I try to cross, even though I do not feel afraid. However, if there is so much as a skinny blade of grass sticking out near the log that I can touch while going across, for a reference, then I have no problem going across and no dizziness. Again, I think the grass is substituting for me not using my peripheral vision!

So, yesterday I tried looking at the two sidelines of the lane I was in, instead of at the cars in front of me. HUGE difference! My eyes were able to relax, just like when I'm not driving. I actually pretended the lines were handrails and I was just walking along pulling my arms along the handrails, and it had a very calming effect. Then I tried actively using my peripheral vision when I had to do one of those big freeway merges that I dread, and I won't say I felt perfect, but it was definitely an improvement.

This morning I went jogging, and tried applying the same principle: Instead of absently staring toward a spot on the pavement straight ahead of me, I purposely looked at two spots in the distance - one for each eye - and wow, I felt so much calmer (not that jogging has ever stressed me out anyway, but the mental experience was completely different). Then I tried balancing on one leg while looking at two points instead of one, and discovered it's way way easier to just calmly stand on one leg when you do it - no wobbling at all!

When time permits, now I have in mind to try 2 more experiments: 1. Crossing a log while looking at both of its edges instead of the middle of the log, and 2. Doing a ""meditative"" exercise gazing at 2 candles placed about eye-width apart, instead of 1 candle in the center.

If some of you have also experience weird visual ""phobia"" symptoms without an actual feeling of fear (except for fear of the symptoms), perhaps this discovery will also help you? I hope so!!",1580075623.0,1.0,0

I just got hit by a huge wave of anxiety out of nowhere,"Yesterday night I had trouble sleeping, it rapidly evolved from being uncomfortable to a full on anxiety attack that lasted the entire night and didn't let me sleep at all.

Every time my eyes closed I would immediately wake up with my heart pounding out of my chest and hyperventilating. It went on for 7 hours until I decided to give up and to not sleep at all.
Ever since then I've been having this horrible feeling of terror, I'm constantly on the verge of having a panic attack and the thought of going to sleep again makes me shiver.
I don't know what's going on but I'm terrified, every second I feel like something horrible could happen to my body.

Do you have an advice or home remedies that could help me wind down?

Is crying a sign of a panic or anxiety attack? (You don't have to read the whole thing),"Hey guys, is crying a sign of a panic or anxiety attack? I was just in class doing a seminar, which I have successfully spoken in many times before and I just started to overthink. I over think all the time, but in this situation it just kept getting worse. I was sitting there in the circle silently, very sweaty and shaky. I was continuously just scratching my school binder with my eyes darting around the room just trying not to give in and cry. After the class ended my teacher asked to talk to me and said something along the lines of ""I noticed that you looked like you wanted to talk, next time just don't overthink it and say what's on your mind. It's okay if you don't think its right or not."" This just made it worse.  I left the class and walked down the hallway increasingly getting freaked out more and more. I called  on of my friends at school but he didn't answer so I texted him to meet me somewhere and the second he got there and said hey I tried to start to explain but I just couldn't speak and just started crying. He asked what was wrong and I didn't know what was wrong. I was just freaking out for no reason. I tried to explain that I didn't know why I was crying but couldn't speak, and just started crying more. I couldn't fully calm down with someone trying to talk to me so after a while I left and went to my friends car and when I sat in the car I started to hyperventilate while crying but luckily it stopped after a few seconds and I was able to control my breath.

Belief in Law of attraction and premonitions worsen my anxiety.,"Before I began, I just want to say I'm not bashing anyone's beliefs. I’m just expressing my experience with it. 

2 years I left my faith (Islam). To be quite honest after I left Islam my anxiety reduced greatly. I didn’t have have to worry about pleasing God anymore, whether I’m going to heaven or hell, didn’t have to worry about keeping up with 5 prayers anymore. Being free of God and religion was very freeing for me. 

However a few months back I started to research about new age beliefs. I came across a YouTube video about law of attraction. I started watching it and became intrigued about. I liked the Idea of being able to just think something and it would happen. 

For those unfamiliar with law of attraction. It basically states that if you have good thoughts, only good things will come to you. If you have negative thoughts then that negative thing will happen.

Now it's a very noble concept. Except when you have anxiety disorder and negative thoughts make up at least half of your thoughts throughout the day. 

When I initially started practicing it, I was feeling good and positive about it. I went out brought ""The secret “ and read a bunch of other books on the subject. I brought special journals so I could script my desired life into existence. 

Things started to take an ugly turn was when my anxiety would flare up. I suffer from GAD and health anxiety. Whenever I would have a bad thought about catching a disease I would freak out because I was afraid that my thought about getting that disease would manifest. 

I tried suppressing my thoughts, but the more I pushed back the more anxious I would get about my negative thoughts manifesting. 

Then I started reading people’s experiences about how they had a sensed something before they died or when something serious would happen to them. And how premonitions is something many people have. 

Now as you all know, when you have anxiety you often feel like something bad is going to happen. So that even made me even more fearful of anxious feelings. 

At this point I feel like practicing law of attraction had been detrimental to my mental health. I feel like I always have to force positive thoughts because I’m fearful of negative thoughts manifesting into existence. 

I know that law of attraction has helped many people with anxiety. However, I feel like there can be a dark side to it, and unfortunately I’m one of those people you has suffered negative effects from it.",1580073715.0,1.0,0

Anyone successfully got off the antipsychotics prescribed for treating anxiety disorders?,"I had GAD, social anxiety and OCD problems when my doc prescribed antipsychotics (olanzapine) and and antidepressants.

I used them for 16 months and 7 days ago I stopped (after being very careful with dosage reduction) as my doc said.

A Story About Getting Better,"I developed anxiety in my early 20s. It roughly coincided with developing IBS, I began to grow very neurotic about food, cooked everything myself, constantly analyzing what I ate and was causing problems, making diet adjustments. This morphed into agoraphobia where at the worst, a walk around the block was pretty terrifying and took a lot of effort to psych myself into. I didn't have immense depression but some at times, but in general just that pervasive never ending feeling that things are awful, and always in a constant cycle of looking for the next thing to worry about. Health anxiety in general became a problem as I was aging. I coped as best I could just by living a strange lifestyle, I work from home, never eat out, don't travel much, etc. Then found out my wife was pregnant unexpectedly. 

I was riding a high when my son was born, had discovered strength training and learned to eat more, put on a much needed 30 lbs. However becoming a parent at this point wasn't something I was ready for, my home was my sanctuary and safe space, and suddenly we were responsible for another human, things were completely chaotic and out of my control. I've always been low energy and prone to anxiety, the days started to be a struggle. I was eating less, not working out, losing weight again, and chronically exhausted. Eventually he started daycare, and then the viruses started going through the house. This was one of my great fears all the way back to childhood, and stomach bugs for whatever reason tended to hit me really hard. Even when they didn't the anxiety made sure I paid a terrible price for any kind of minor illness. 

The health anxiety reared its heard several times when I just couldn't cope with minor health issues I didn't understand. Things hit rock bottom in the summer of 2018 for me. I started developing weird health symptoms, losing feeling in my hands and feet, having trouble controlling them, then before long dizziness, waking up with no feeling in my legs, vision problems. This was far more than I could cope with and the anxiety ate me alive, I wasn't eating well, couldn't sleep much, my wife and son were to be away for a long trip and I was alone coping with it all. 

Before this I'd tried cognitive behavioral therapy in 2014, which was helpful but didn't really take fully, and two attempts to get onto medication, which I was terrified to do. Sertraline seemed to be working but was upsetting my stomach and I gave up in a few weeks. Paxil was making me sleepy but a week in I had a severe reaction I attributed to it in the middle of the night where I spent a couple hours shaking on the bathroom floor trying to vomit, no idea if it was actually the medication or not, probably wasn't. 

In the midst of everything in 2018 I tried therapy again, this time with a different therapist who was a little better suited for me. I worked with my doctor, got a lot of things checked out, but she consistently gently kept trying to steer me towards trying medication again. I was still quite scared of the stuff as I'm sure most people are when you're fighting anxiety, I remember thinking it was a fake solution, it was dangerous, it wouldn't work, etc. This time it was Trintellix, she wanted me to go slow to avoid any side effects that might scare me off so I started at 5mg once a day and stayed there for months.

I recoded everything in those days and within a week my anxiety levels started dropping. Slowly but surely my health symptoms started to unravel and I started to get my life back and rediscover my personality I had in my teenage years. It took time but the improvements were consistent. I never went up over that 5mg and it's been a year and a half now. I feel like an entirely different person, I can feel it plain as day now, there was something wrong with me and whatever relationship seratonin has with anxity was involved. Combined with the tools I gained in therapy I'm able to see the world in a much more realistic and positive light than I was before. I've regained all the weight I lost, and improved my energy levels, not 100% normal but better. The medication does seem to give me a little trouble sleeping which I counteract with supplements or at worst, .25mg of ativan. It's a small price to pay.

All told I dealt with anxiety for about 17 years. It's hard to imagine what things might have been like if I'd only taken action sooner. None the less I have my life back and I'm eternally grateful for it.

Just wanted to share my story. Make sure you take steps, anything available to you, and don't let your brain convince you you've tried everything. Life's too short to let anxiety rule it for you. If you can't answer the question ""what steps am I taking to try to fix this"", you need to try harder.

Wishing all of you struggling with this the best, I remember it so clearly and reading so many posts here reminds me what it was like. It's horrible, at times debilitating, but I think it makes us stronger and better people in the end.",1580071951.0,1.0,3
"I Think We Need To Talk (About Current Events and Whatnot, Possible TW/CW; SERIOUS)","Hi, subreddit. I think we need to have a talk about current events. This isn't my first rodeo in worrying about these things, but I think we need to talk. Remember, NO rude comments, this is a serious discussion.

Iran. The coronavirus. Brushfires. I know, it's a cauldron of bad news. And it also makes one wonder about the worst-case scenario. I keep hearing comments like ""We should be worried about the end of the world!""

But at the same time, I say to a chattering room ""EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UP!"" It isn't going to help to overreact to these things, and I keep seeing memes about these things. Yes, I know everyone has their own coping mechanisms, but at the same time some of these things give off anxiety as well.

Why do we always have to worry about things I hear in the news that are largely beyond my control? Is it a natural thing, because of anxiety? It always seems like all you hear in the news is negative events. There's plenty of good, as I stated, but how the media is like in North America isn't helping things. There wasn't always a 24-hour news cycle, and the current presidential administration is giving me worries about its unpredictabilities. Yes, I sometimes fear the worse, but I also have to tell myself that things may not be as bad as they seem.

And then, all of the news I hear is largely out of my control. And I have to, at the same time, have to live my life the best I can in spite of what's going on.

It's one thing to be informed, but to let all that news disrupt your life to the point where you just can't live it properly is quite another. 

I also wanted to add this: There are now so many news sources these days, and some of them may be ""fake"", and some are opinion, and it's hard to tell what's true and what isn't; and some news sources uses ""loaded"" words to invoke fear.

Walked out of exams, slept through exams, yeah, not great. But again, puberty may not have helped.

Aged 16-19 I was on and off Sertraline/zoloft at different doses, with a few months break to see if it had helped.
At 50mg,my anxiety reduced slightly. At 100mg, I was having almost no panic attacks, apart from a few that were caused by new stressors introduced into my life. I also felt my depression was a bit better -
I still had low self image but I was feeling hopeful about the future. Later, last year when I experienced a heck load of bereavements in the space of a few months, I got bumped up to 200mg. This didn't seem to have any effect, but at this point I think I was too far into my new grief-depression hole for meds to reach me.

Still aged 19, over the last few months, I have been a bit of a walking trainwreck if trainwrecks kept trying to kill themselves (lowkey pun bc it was a traintrack I tried to jump on). After a couple of hospital visits/sections and visits daily from MH nurses, I've tried promethazine and diazepam (anxiety wise). 

Promethazine made me feel a bit chilled our, but made me sleepy as hell the next day. 

Diazepam (6mg a day) hasnt really helped, and taking 10-12mg when I was panicking didnt really help either.


So has anyone had similar experiences? Anyone been lucky enough to find one that helps calm their anxiety? 

Tl;dr Sertraline helped the most but stopped helping after 100mg, what has helped you?",1580069120.0,1.0,2
Anxiety sparked by Kobe Bryant’s passing,For some reason my anxiety spiked when I heard the news. It’s not a full blown attack but I just don’t understand why something like this would cause me to feel like this right now. Something that happened to somebody else.

I wanna cry really badly,"Whenever I asked my parents to take me to a professional, they refused me constantly. They said (and still say) that it's normal to ""be nervous"". Yeah, like no. If I'm in a crowd, I almost get a panic attack, and I don't think that's a normal response to situations like this.

There was a time when I *really* needed a psychologist, but my parents refused and got angry. Mom told me ""People who need professional help don't think that they need it."" And I believed her. After this, my dad said ""You don't need a psychologist, you're not schyzophrenic."". So, my anxiety and the likely anxiety attacks got undiagnosed and it still is. I fought my way through those dreadful feelings *all alone*. Nobody was with me and nobody helped me.

Turns out, my mother implemented those thoughts into my father's mind about psychologists.

Still, if those dreadful feelings don't hit me on the streets anymore, they hit me in school and after school when I'm home. Also, I think I have depression, though I'm not sure.

I started to realize how my parents just didn't tend to my emotional well-being.

Can anxiety be an excuse for making a mistake?,"I (17f) recently got diagnosed with anxiety after years of on and off symptoms. Particularly, this past year has been very rough for me and I’ve become a lot more anxious: this includes high irritability, perfectionism, reminisce, all of which lead me to overthink and overreact to just about everything. This then leads me to become angry with myself and then act even more irrationally.

It’s caused a lot of issues with a really good friend, and actually cost me his friendship. I kept overthinking and overreacting to everything for months, despite knowing it was wrong. But I couldn’t control myself. I tried so many times to just relax and do the right thing and let go of the situation but I couldn’t help myself. In those moments, I feel as if I’ve lost all control of myself and my mind. I feel awful. I hurt and pushed away someone who I care about tremendously, and I wish there was a way for me to control my thoughts and my reactions. I just felt like I couldn’t do it. Overthinking and overreacting happened over and over and over again, about dumb stuff, and I would be able to push it off for a few hours but I just felt myself crumbling and giving into an urge to react negatively, even though I didn’t want to. And it makes me feel so ill and angry with myself that I am unable to change despite knowing something I’m doing is wrong.

I really don’t want to use anxiety as an excuse for repeatedly overthinking and overreacting. I didn’t know how to control myself, and I didn’t understand why is was happening for so long.

For clarification: I’m not at all the type of person who acts like an asshole and blames it on anxiety or stress, etc. I don’t want to use it as an excuse, and I don’t plan on doing so. I always admit to when I’m wrong and try my hardest to change. But this was just something that I couldn’t control and change no matter how hard I tried.

I am starting therapy in hopes for improvement and I hope to manage my anxious symptoms much better than I have been :)",1580068049.0,1.0,2
DAE find themselves obsessing over coronavirus news(trigger warning disease?),"Well it's exactly what it says on the tin, really. I've been obsessively checking the news about the wuhan coronavirus; i know it's probably counterproductive, but not doing it just makes me much more worried than I am if I do.

I don't exactly have a continuously diagnosed or treated anxiety disorder, but a few years ago I did have several panic attacks over health stuff, and was told by my GP that tl;dr i feel scared and crappy because anxiety. I think i've always been, and still am, a bit health-anxious, and epidemics/pandemics are my actual worst nightmare. For instance I can't imagine what living through ebola 2014-16 was like for people, but hearing about a sick healthcare worker being brought back for treatment in my country made me have a panic attack, cry and seriously ask my mom to move me to Siberia. This a couple months after reading about ebola (very early on) and being surprised to find I wasn't ""too scared of that stuff anymore"".

I'm trying to be rational about this. I study in the UK now, and there have been no confirmed cases here; I haven't travelled anywhere near china; I'm pretty sure i'm fine for now. Reading news of more people's tests coming back negative over here is almost a relief, which is probably why I keep doing it. But several (presumably not sick) study enrichment students from Wuhan were in my uni under a week ago, and the way people talk/joke about it is already making me uneasy. I'm worried even if I \*think\* I've overcome this fear, I really haven't (again, like with ebola), and am dreading the possibility of having to emotionally handle a deadly virus being in my town/uni while living in close quarters with other people and managing my increasing workload. It's wearing me down a bit, I'm not sleeping well, and my heart has been going at like 110 bpm at rest. At the same time being uninformed is kinda terrifying in its own right, more so than reading all the news right now.

So uh, can anyone relate?",1580067748.0,0.88,3

someone to talk to,"Hi, 
I count myself pretty lucky with where i’m at with anxiety(or what i’m 99% sure is anxiety as i’ve never had the nerve to go see someone or talk to anyone about it). I do have a lot of trouble as a result and it does affect my life, but compared to a lot of accounts of what i’ve heard, i’m pretty lucky to be able to overcome it in certain situations ie talking to someone new or dealing with something looming over me, but the main issue that i have with it is the misunderstanding and lack of knowledge that the majority of people have. Because of this i’ve never had a conversation with anyone who can understand, let alone relate to what i’m saying. So, I have to assume theres someone on here that must be in the same situation and potentially has it way worse than me but doesn’t have anyone to tell about it and feels stuck and lost and alone. it’s extremely important to be able to talk to someone and i haven’t had that and that’s made my relatively manageable and mild anxiety a whole lot harder.

I worry about the time it takes out of my day, I worry that I'm going to do something wrong, I worry that I won't get along with the management or my coworkers. I just worry. Social anxiety doesn't help either, because there are so many people that work there and my whole job is customer service.

Job hunting and terrified!,"I'm currently feeling decent about things so I'm taking the initiative to really get into my job hunt. But I'm still terrified! Not just from the hunt, but my anxiety is from the thought of actually hearing back from any of these jobs, or even getting a job.

Not diagnosed but pretty clearly have social anxiety. All the jobs I've had was because I knew someone there. This is the first time actually job hunting, first time also planning to move out from home, should I get a job where I'd like to move. And I'm nervous the most about having to interact with new people, and kind of sell myself to get a job.

I'm so freakin anxious about this. I have very little confidence in my work ability, which I know isn't rational, as it's not like I haven't worked and my employers liked me. But it's like, I know something they don't. I know I'm not always in it, or doing my best, or maybe just the best. Sometimes my best isn't great but I'm trying.

We spoke for a long time on the phone, but in person it was difficult.. but still on okay.

Her famous words were ""Shut up!"" And it was always spoke with low venom. Like it was a warning.. 

My children are my world, but sometimes my husband tells my children to shut up when they don't listen. He told them today at dinner to shut up, cos they won't listen to him and he is fed up. 

And it took me straight back to my mum cos she also said that. I have told my husband in the past that it is a trigger to me, and he apologizes but sometimes he just snaps. But in that moment I sat and cried.. cos I didn't want my mum to do that but she did it anyway :(",1580062391.0,1.0,0

Having a hard time being in a relationship while having anxiety,"I (F18) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (M22) for about 1 year and 7 months. I have been dealing with anxiety and depression since I was 15. I have told my boyfriend about it and he assured me that he will love me no matter what. Things were going really great as first and he seemed very understanding towards my anxiety and panic attacks the first few times and is always there for me. However, as it occured more and more as months went by, I noticed he started getting more frustrated each time.
Every time I randomly broke down or had a panic attack, he would question me and say things like “can’t you just tell me what’s wrong”, “why aren’t you talking to me” in a frustrated tone. And because i struggle to speak while hyperventilating and I can’t think straight, I would just keep saying that i don’t know and he would seem so annoyed. 
I understand how hard it is to be in his position, especially since he does not know much about anxiety and hence he probably does not understand that I have a hard time explaining myself and expressing my thoughts during such a state. I have told him before that I have a hard time speaking and answering him when i’m in the midst of a panic attack / breakdown because all my thoughts are a mess and sometimes i‘m not even sure what triggers it. 
But even after i tell him that, he would still get frustrated the next time it happens again. And because he seems so frustrated, it makes me even more anxious and causes me to break down even more. I tried telling him over and over again that I am not ignoring his questions and that he is not the cause of my attacks. I have also told him that this happens a lot and I can’t control it. But I feel like despite having said that to him, he still does not understand and would get mad. I know he is trying and he is frustrated probably because he cares and wants me to get better. 
Once I tried sending him links on how to deal with someone with anxiety. I told him that maybe reading up about it would help him understand better. But again, he got frustrated the next time I had an attack. And I’m guessing that he didn’t read the links at all. 
To make matters worse, he even told me to “just stop it” whenever i broke down / started having irrational thoughts and i felt as though my feelings were being disregarded. Whenever I tried to explain about my past or something that could’ve caused me to be this way, it felt as though he wasn’t interested and would just dismiss it. But maybe it’s just me being overly sensitive and maybe he didn’t mean to come off that way. 
Also, he would apologise every single time I told him that I don’t want him to get annoyed whenever I broke down, but the same thing would happen all over again the next time.
He keeps telling me that all he wants is for me to get better, but idk why I feel that sometimes he’s doing the wrong things to help. Sometimes all I need is for him to just be there for me and comfort me during tough times, but instead he keeps demanding me for answers and appears annoyed and i don’t know how to tell him that. Recently i tried telling him again to read the links i sent if he really wanted to help me get better, but he started talking about how I should help myself by seeking help from a professional (which I have done before when i was 15 but it didn’t work out so well). I just kinda wish he would stop focusing on me being the problem and learn to help ease my anxiety instead of triggering it even more every time by getting mad. It’s not his fault that he doesn’t understand much about anxiety and I don’t blame him for it. I just can’t help but to feel that it would be so much easier if he would just give me the time I need to get over my panic attacks and maybe give me some encouragement too. But I don’t want to be too needy and be too “high maintenance” for him. I really love him and it hurts to see how upset he is over my mental state. 

What should I do or how should I tell him about all this?
Am I being too demanding and burdensome for wanting all that from him? If I am, how can i make things better for the both of us?

The idea of dying scares me. What can I tell myself to ease my anxiety when I’m worried about dying?,"I would just like to start this by saying I am not suicidal. After proof reading my post I realized it can come across that way. In summary, what I’m trying to say in this post, is that the thought of something killing me (sickness, car accident, etc) is a huge source of anxiety for me and is making it difficult to focus throughout the day. How can I get rid of this anxiety? I figured if I find a new way to think about death and dying, maybe it’ll help. 

———

I am not religious. I used to be catholic but recently realized that it wasn’t for me. I believe that once I die, that’s it. I simply seize to exist (I don’t know if this is the reason for this new anxiety but that’s for a different post, I think). 

This past year, every skinned knee and cold gets my anxiety going and I worry that it’s going to kill me. I begin by telling myself that it’s just a cold, it won’t kill me. Then I tell myself, if I truly feel my life is in danger, I can always go to the hospital and get medical help. 

This chain goes on until I get to: if it is going to kill me, oh well. Then I die and that’s it. It sucks but it’s no longer my problem. 

This hasn’t been helping all that much lately and I’ve been having really bad anxiety all day for the past month and it’s getting exhausting. 

Does anyone have any advice for how I can cope with these anxious thoughts of death?",1580058049.0,0.81,4

I have so much anxiety when it comes to being invited out somewhere by anyone,"It could be anyone from a best friend to a close family member. I always think that I’m their last resort and that they have asked everyone else and they all said no or had a reason to not go. So then their forced to ask me, the last one on their list. Plus, leaving the comfort of my own home is a recipe for disaster. When I’m outside of my own house things become unpredictable and I feel like I’ve lost all control. So I either end up cancelling or leaving early. But then on the flip side the other person could leave early and leave me alone, or leave because I’m boring and their not having as much fun. Or maybe we run into someone who they know and I don’t and it’s a whole other social situation that I have zero control over.

I feel so anxious about decisions I have to make.,"So, recently I got a new job and they offered me a good salary. I need to talk to my manager tomorrow, I think that will go well.

So the panic problem goes here...  
In the offer proposed they asked me for documents and acknowledgements, I was expecting that the company will explicitly ask me for resigning, so after 1 week of submitting the documents, I asked the HR that when will I receive the offer letter, they said that I already received it(it was included in the documents that I acknowledged). Now they mentioned a date of joining that is little shorter than 2 months of notice period, DOJ is 16th march and 2 months from tomorrow will be 27th March(2 months is my notice period), although the HR said that DOJ can be changed but I want go home once to see my family at least for a week, so I was thinking after the notice period I can take a gap for a week and then join.

I am panicking that I have already delayed the process by mistake and now it might be too much to ask from the HR to make the DOJ around 5th of April.

Also I have to find another home before ending my job here.

It might be a small thing or a big thing, but when writing this post my face went red, my heart beat is faster and now I don't feel like eating, I literally want to cry . I have realised recently about myself that I seek validation for even small decisions, I need to talk to people before anything big comes into my life.

I just saw a cockroach and didn’t have a panic attack for the first time in my life,"I’m utterly speechless. I can’t believe this.

I’ve had a deep set phobia of cockroaches since I was about 10 and about 2 years ago started getting therapy as it had delved into generalised anxiety about bugs in general and, in addition to other mental health problems, had become pretty debilitating. Eventually with time the GAD died down and the panic attacks and phobia were really only related to the cockroaches again.

I started exposure therapy about 2 weeks ago.
It’s not nice but I’m doing it and I’m so proud. My first 2 weeks were just staring at a cartoon pic for 20 mins and am now upgraded to looking at a real one.

However, I just saw a cockroach and didn’t have a panic attack. I’m alone, at work, it is 12.24am and i was just going to the loo and I saw it crawl across the kitchen floor. I didn’t freak- I just walked into my room and shut the door. I put a blanket under to make me feel better but holy fuck.

Mental problems," I was watching a youtube video and I ended up having a compulsion ""must not watch a specific dialogue in this scene""  I do not remember how this compulsion was created but some thoughts without my will popped up about a promise to an other God.    I closed the video but I started searching to find which video it was. I do not remember why. was it another compulsion or was I was searching to make sure to remember it in order to avoid clicking it in the future? I do not remember. the second scenario makes it more scary. and another scary scenario is how the compulsion was created. Was it created because I was carefree and these thoughts without my will about a promise to an other God pop up? or was there a compulsion telling me to watch the dialogue and because I did not want to, new thoughts without my will popped up? the new thoughts without my will are about a new fake promise to an other God about not doing the compulsion. they pop up due to frustration because I want relief from my ocd. since these new thoughts without my will force me not to do the compulsion, for a second, maybe I act as if they matter in order to trick my ocd and I feel relieved. But I cant remember or understand why I end up in this situation. I know these thoughts without my will that relieve me, will give me more worries later but I cant control them. I reminded myself many times not to have these thoughts withoug my will and not feel relieved. and if they pop up, to pray to an other God to tell Him that they are without my will but instead of that, I maybe act as if they matter. are they still 100% thoughts without my will or not? I worry because I accidentally saw some seconds of that video and i freaked. another reason I worry is because these days, my thoughts without my will that create compulsions are very scary. sometimes, they have the word God as if they are addressed to Him. I tried to forget these scary thoughts without my will to avoid being in a situation like I am now. I try not even think the word promise and now I worry? I have prayed to an other God many times and asked Him to protect me from these thoughts without my will and no matter what not to accept promises. the new scary thoughts without my will are about promises and punishments that scare me. I tried to forget them but I cant. I tried not to end up having compulsions but I failed. I overpayed and still overpay and I still worry. how could I end up worrying? I overpray and try not even think the word promise. i keep reminding myself not to have new thoughts without my will that relieve me but I cant stop it. and i cant remember how much strong or how much scary they were. if they were not that strong or scary, I do not think I would try to find the video to make sure to ignore it on the future. it does not make sense. maybe it was just an other compulsion. most of the times, I remember the scary thoughts without my will or how much strong they were, but in this case I do not remember them. perhaps they were just not so scary or strong thoughts? how could I forgot them? It is like, for a second, I forget about the worries I will be having in the future. Maybe my system allows the new thoughts without my will that force me not to do the compulsion,  on purpose, due to frustration, but sometimes these thoughts without my will, automatically are accompanied with scary thoughts without my will about punishments. And I am like "" now i do not have to do the compulsion. i am relieved and free. oh wait. were the thoughts 100% without my will or not? I dont know"" I end up confused and more worried. the same case has happened more than 15 times, probably. I try to forget them. i try not to make compulsions. i try not even think the word promise and I always end up worried.                ocd: too bad. you are allowing yourself to have new thoughts without your will in orde to force yourself not to do an old compulsion. maybe you mean them for a second. and you are so unlucky that these new thoughts without your will are accompanied with scary punishments. maybe if you meant them for a second, maybe the other God made those promises valid.               I pray to an other God, not Jesus, just to be sure.             ocd: maybe the other God accepts the thoughts without your will.",1580053723.0,1.0,0

Today he tried to film himself for a college application, where he had to answer a question on camera (eg what is your favorite color and why).

Very Fixated on my cognitive functioning to the point I can't enjoy myself.,"Been suffering from cognitive problems for a while stemming from mental illness and poor sleep habits. Recently I started taking Vitamin D after being diagnosed with a deficiency (a bad one apparently), and I have noticed my cognitive functionings being way better since I started...but the other problem is because I've been sorta slow and non functioning for so long I can't relax and are very FIXATED on checking to see if my cognitive functioning has declined or improved. 

For instance, I try to get myself to memorize the URLs of youtube videos (the random assortment of letters and numbers in upper and lower case) and have successfully done so, but at other times I struggle and when that happens I start to freak out and assume the Vitamin D has ""stopped working"" (how the hell does that happen with a vitamin like that?) due to reading depressing reports from people in similar situations who claim they stopped getting benefits from things that helped them for apparently no reason. 

It gets really bad if I have a day where I don't sleep properly. I start to think that ""Oh crap it's not working anymore!"" when I find I can't memorize things or motivate myself as well. On days where I sleep long enough the benefits seem to return but if I sleep poorly or not long enough (like today), I become very anxious and can't relax and assume there is no hope for me.

Hopefully if I sleep at an earlier time tonight I will be fine tomorrow. I do need to take vitamin K with it to ease some joint/muscle cramp problems I've had but hopefully I can take a higher dose eventually and improve even more, but it's stressful and I can't turn my brain off.

Exercise,"So I would say my anxiety ranges from just above non existent (occasionally nervous social interactions), to moderately severe (end up cancelling plans with fiends out of anxiety, difficulty leaving my room, etc.) and I was recently prescribed Zoloft by a doctor. 

The doctor was just a general practitioner so he was probably a bit quick to prescribe meds. I went through some fairly severe (couldn’t get up, sat and cried, physical pain through the day) anxiety for a few days just thinking about being on the meds. 

My usual anxiety isn’t the can’t fall asleep at night, nervous about exams, worried about the future kind of anxiety. I more have a general fear of feeling sick even when I know my symptoms are psychoactive. I absolutely hate the idea of traveling as I get panic attacks just driving to the airport but am usually functional once I get to my destination. I have some OCD type symptoms where all I can think about is my anxiety and how it’s effecting me, ritualising particular activities, etc. I have an overarching existential dread that I carry around. I go out of my wan on a day to day basis to avoid particular situations that might give me unnecessary anxiety (same exact meal every day for lunch from the same exact place, avoid going out to eat).

##So the question I have is...

I am considering (after having read a number of studies and reports which I will link below) trying to out myself on an exercise regimen. Just 5 days a week, go and do some cardio work on a bike at the gym or something. I am also considering seeing a psychiatric specialist depending on how my anxiety persists. 

My question to you all is how effective has exercise been for you? I know that the anxiety won’t just go away, I just hope to have an easier time managing it.

We actually just had a fight a week ago because she thinks I am the one who leaving her. Let me get this straight: a boyfriend could never leave her girlfriend without a reason, right? 

As in that context, she could not talk with me for almost 2 days, she would not eat food that I bought, eventually I feel disrespected. Food requires money, and in my current economy condition, that is just a waste. When I wake up, she is just going to work, without waking me up or something. I think I had enough, then I pack my things and leaving my own rented condo. In the evening she eventually realized my things are not there anymore. She ask to break up. I am okay with that back then. But her suicidal behavior is causing mess. Luckily there is nothing serius but I know her hand could hurt (she tries to cut on her left hand but I guess the cuts are not deep -- which she do this I think to get me back -- and I am fall for it)

We meet again and talked through this again -- she was under stress at work because she cant keep up for everything happened -- but she already told me like days ago -- and in my nature of handling a job, yesterday is just yesterday -- I even tell to her just dont think about it and stay focused, but it seem she can't do that.

What is more disapponting, is, she want me to get thru her insecurities, but she dont mention about what she can do back for me. I think it is more like give and take -- two way relationship -- which that what should be happened. I think I feel I give a lot -- but I still don't know what I can expect in return. I feel drained -- my emotion, even my money. I dont have savings since March 2019 -- I used to have money but I am all loss. 

She posted me this article, talked about her anxiety [https://themighty.com/2016/08/a-letter-to-my-boyfriend-about-my-anxiety/](https://themighty.com/2016/08/a-letter-to-my-boyfriend-about-my-anxiety/?utm_source=Mighty_MH_Page&utm_medium=Facebook&utm_campaign=Link_Contributor&fbclid=IwAR3oz_0GzajJ3Qk9QaN_kL4QKADr9-CCfbsz_5qUALljjKKLzhP1XrFovZQ) but heck, I dont even care about it right now.

Do you guys agree if she is being controlling and abusive to me? Despite her anxiety -- which she could say it was the culprit -- but I cannot verify myself? 

I also dont mentioned yet  ""compassion fatigue"" to her becausr it is like a word I just discovered today. 

What would you guys say to her when you were me?

I am sorry for such short post, I am kinda hurry, because I need to go back to my condo to visit..my gf again...which cannot be left alone. Sucks. I don't feel motivated and I want everything end soon.",1580046533.0,1.0,3

Stress of pet ownership heightens my anxiety,"tl;dr - I went from living alone with one cat to living with my gf who has 2 long haired cats and a high maintenance 40kg bloodhound. We both clean the house constantly but it's never enough for me to feel clean.

I am usually pretty good at dealing with anxiety symptoms, one main coping mechanism I've always had is having a safe, quiet, clean space to recharge - my house - or at very least my bedroom. Living with housemates was too stressful so I ended up renting on my own which was expensive but good for my anxiety.

Being clean and anxiety over being unclean is big for me. I constantly wash my hands, and don't like to even touch anything after I've showered. I push through it most of the time, but I still need to know things around me are generally clean - coffee table, couch, benches, etc. My house isn't spotless and I don't even use many chemicals - I just need to know there's no bacteria (even though logically I know there is bacteria everywhere).

I have had one cat for about 5 years and she has always been a great source of calm and happiness for me, she hangs out with me wherever I am and sleeps in my bed. She is well trained and is quiet throughout the night not disturbing my sleep (I have sleep issues). I would clean and completely disinfect her litter tray about twice a week - it only took me \~20 minutes of feeling awfully gross and unclean and then I would immediately shower.

Now, we have three indoor cats - cleaning the litter tray anywhere from 3-6 times a day (we always clean poos immediately, and wee whenever it needs it). My gf handles the dogs backyard herself, which is good. Plus they need to be fed twice a day - four bowls. So eight bowls of raw meat, stinky pet biscuits, refreshing water bowls, etc., each day. My gf walks the dog every single day and I try to go along when I can to be supportive but I get sweaty and dirty. We also provide enrichment so there's always toys/feathers/scratch towers hanging around, and the dog gets pigs ears inside and bones outside, etc. Gf's two cats are both extremely long haired and fluffy - even if I vacuum every single day there is still balls of fluff that are floating around the house (my cat also contributes but is short haired). Because we live in a hot part of the world (Australia) we have to bring the dog in on hot days, so she often spends a few hours in the middle of the day inside, and always comes in after dinner for an hour or two before going to bed in her crate inside the house (she has anxiety so is crate-trained), so she brings in dirt, slobber that ends up on the walls even though we wipe her face, and her fur too. There's also her huge crate with her smelly blankets in one part of the house, we wash the blankets a lot but it's a dog bed - always gunna smell. Sometimes at the end of the day after dinner and shower and I get to just watch tv the dog might come over and if I'm particularly anxious that day I can't even handle her touching/sniffing me and I get upset and my gf tries to take the dog away but I've already been touched. I feel really fucking stupid but then again I got through the whole day being dirty, this is my quiet time before bed to feel clean and it's ruined.

Apart from the cleaning, the cats sometimes fight (which makes me stressed because its my three legged cat that's always being bullied), or some of them decide to meow in the middle of the night, or use the litter tray - whatever it may be.

I feel like I'm living in a zoo and some days I'm strong enough to handle it but some days it drives me insane and it feels like there's no escape. I have a study that I can spend time in but it's really hot because the air conditioning doesn't get to that side of the house. Sometimes I just want to relax on the couch not dealing with an animal. I don't really feel I can leave the house to relax either as we moved to a city so I'm away from my friends/family (no one to visit) and there's always people/traffic - can't go for a quiet drive or go to the beach etc., like I used to, to relax.

I can't ask her to get rid of her pets and I'm not getting rid of mine. A different house won't solve anything. We already spend an incredible amount of time per day cleaning. If I cut back on my cleaning/caring duties, my gf has to take it all on herself. Idk. Does anyone have any experience with this? Help :(

Anxious about death,"Ive always been anxious about the idea of death, more so recently, when someone talks about it, or if im in bed at night i just can't get it out of my mind.

Overwhelmed and anxious,"So I have been feeling super anxious this past week. There was lots of things going on but it has really upset me that I can't shake the feeling. I have even been dreaming about it. 

I am ill with a cold right now which in a way has contributed but I can't help but feel really emotional. 

It hasn't been that long since I have started working and due to the nature of the work I do, the hours are not set exactly. I always feel like I am either not working enough or too much. 

I have woken up today feeling really low, I dunno, I am so fed up of being anxious, having intrusive thoughts and feeling alone.",1580043330.0,0.92,0
Should I start taking medication?,"I am diagnosed with social anxiety and GAD. I started therapy 2 months ago, it helped me to understand my condition, but I still struggle with daily activities (going to university, out with friends, etc). For example, I went with a friend to a yoga class; I had a panic attack there, so I spent the rest of the day dissociating. It worries me that I have to put on hold most activities because they can trigger in me a panic attack (so far breathing exercises and other forms or relaxation haven't helped me), while at the same time, causing my social life to disappear. 
I was on Zoloft once, but I reacted to it very poorly (I ended up taking 1/4 of the dose, anything above it and I experienced side effects. I also weren't on therapy back then, my psychiatrist prescribed it to me so I can finish high school). My therapist said, that my reaction to sertraline could be connected to my body weight (I am small and underweight).
Which brings me to question: should I try taking medication again? If not Zoloft, maybe something else? And should I expect similar side effects?",1580043116.0,0.67,1
What can I do to help a loved one with OCD/anxiety?,"My girlfriend has been struggling to cope with anxiety and OCD over the past few years. Everyday she goes through a number of OCD routines to cope with her impulsive thoughts and help with her anxiety. It seems to peak and trough but when she goes through periods (1 - 2 month) of where almost everything will trigger her it really puts a strain on our relationship.

She won't always open up to me during the bad times and has always said that I never know the full extent of the routines and impulses she has to deal with. It has got particularly bad in the past few months, she has a phobia of fainting and felt very faint whilst giving a presentation at work a few months ago and is now unable to give presentations for the fear of fainting (50% of her job is this so is really impacting her work). 

I try my best to be as supportive as possible and when she has a panic attack I am the only person who can calm her down. However I am worried over a couple of things and need some advice on how best to help her. 

I am worried that she is building too much of a dependency on me to help her during her episodes and panic attacks, which I think it has manifested itself in when she is alone, small anxiety attacks can now quite frequently turn into full blown panic attacks where I need to drop everything and come home to help her calm down. 

I also need some help on how to help her over come this, she went to get some CBT therapy 18 months ago but her head wasn't fully in it and didn't take anything from it.

We have a lot of chats on how we're going to tackle this and she always has a number of ideas to help herself but in all honestly she never follows through with them and it's frustrating for me as we have the same chat every couple of months. My attempts to push her are normally met with tears and accusations that I don't know what she's doing to help herself.

What can I do myself to help? I am happy to pay for private therapy (UK based and NHS is 6 month + wait) but I don't want to spend a few thousand pound if it's going to be wasted as her head won't 100% be in it.

How should I treat her when she is doing a routine to deal with her impulse? Do I ignore it? Do I tell her she doesn't need to do it? Do I try and get her to not do it for a bit? Shall I get her to talk about it after she's done it?",1580042364.0,0.84,2
Terrified of presenting my Master's project,"I had a panic attack in front of my class while presenting a project a few months ago and have been petrified of this happening again. The professors have been so understanding about it that I have even been able to opt out of presenting when I have felt the anxiety was too high. 

I do have a letter from my doctor that I could possibly give to my school's disability center so that I could present the project via video recording. However, my anxiety is preventing me from even asking. I'm ashamed that I will be viewed as a cop out for asking to not present or that they will deny my request, which will increase my chances of a panic attack that day. 

I'm not sure who to talk to or if I should just force myself to go through with the presentation. The anxiety has been so bad, though that I have even begun having suicidal fantasies about ending it just to get out of this presentation (Not serious thoughts but still not good). I'm stuck.

Strange feeling in my head (Anyone else have it?),"Hi everyone,
 
For a few months now I'm dealing with anxiety treatment. 
 
It seems to get a little better, even with really bad times still going on.
 
But there is one thing that it is triggering my anxiety and I'm curious to know if someone feels something alike.
 
Basically, I'm having a constant strange kind of physical feeling in my head.
 
I'm not sure how to explain, the best I can do is this: like when you feel a metallic taste in your mouth, but with me is in the whole head. Like there is something inside.
 
Then this starts to get harder and harder in my head, which just makes me freeze what I'm doing and silently freak out until I start crying compulsively.

Does anyone else constantly feel like they’re about to die,"I know this sounds stupid but with all the symptoms of anxiety and the random pains, palps, breathlessness, numbness, weakness, not wanting to eat, just everything, does anyone else feel like they’re about to die just constantly.

Like a couple times an hour I’ll get a wave of emotion and it’s like my blood rushes to my feet and I go cold and I can’t breathe and I feel my heart jumping out my chest and I genuinely think I’m about to die, it’s by far the most terrifying feeling in this world. I feel like I’m about to slip away or drop dead or collapse or have a heart attack. I start to shake and it’s like I wanna start shakinf everywhere for a second and then I feel numb like I’m about to slip away. 

Am I the only one who gets this or does anyone else? Also if you do suffer with this, how do you combat it. It’s like I’ve lost all motivation. I’ve been feeling this for three weeks now and it’s just getting worse and worse like I’m descending into a mental breakdown. I can’t stop it and it’s ruining my life. It’s like every second of my day is spent with chest pain and feeling sick and nausea and random pains and twinges everywhere. Everything I feel scares me and my doctor refuses to give me any medication apart from beta blockers (which are not working for me) and I’m stuck on a long ass waiting list for CBT and a psychological assessment. 

I can’t do this anymore can someone please give me any kind of help or tips. I’ve tried breathing exercises, drinking lots of water, going for walks, just everything and I still spend every day feeling like I’m about to die it’s unbareable.

I had a horrible feeling,"Two weeks ago, I was supposed to go to my best friend's house for the weekend, but in the days before I had this horrible feeling. The kind of feeling where you can't tell if it's a gut instinct or if it's just anxiety. It caused enough anxiety where I was unable to function and I didn't know if I was supposed to go or if something was going to go horribly wrong. 

My family was sick with the flu (I was feeling fine and they were fully aware and fine with it as long as I felt totally okay) and I was worried that I was going to get sick while I was there. On top of that, the weather was supposed to be bad the next day when my family was supposed to pick me up. I was so worried that I was going to get sick or my family was going to get into a horrible accident on their way to pick me up. I couldn't figure out if I was just anxious or if it was my gut. 

But despite my feelings, I decided to go to her house. 

And ya know what happened? 

Absolutely nothing. 

I went along. I had a wonderful time. We talked and laughed and got each other caught up on our lives. We played video games and watched horror games until we fell asleep and then woke up and played more video games. 

My family came and got me safely and then we all went home safely. 

I feel like this is almost a type of breakthrough as far as telling the difference between anxiety and instinct. It's a big problem that I've had. And I feel like this almost drew a line for me. 

I just felt like sharing this little victory. I felt like you guys could appreciate it. I'm not doing great, but knowing that I can still learn to manage makes me feel hopeful :)",1580036675.0,0.91,3
Anyone also anxiety around needing to use the bathroom?,"5 years ago my anxiety disorder started the week I went to a casino. I had to pee really badly and when I got out of the toilet, the urge was not gone. I spent the whole night thinking I was gonna pee myself any second. 

About two years ago, diarrhea joined this party. With high anxiety I would go number 2 like five times a day even. If there is no toilet, I would be really stressed and afraid of accidents. Basically, I could not go anywhere... 

Even though now after therapy I control it to the point I have even traveled to other countries, I can only do so with people I truly trust. I just need to believe the person I am with would be cool even if my pants would be ruined.

I really want to go out more with friends but the conversation of ""what would you do if I would shit myself"" is not exactly normal and a bad answer is really not easy for me to handle.

Just came back from the ER with a panic attack,"I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety as since I came remember. When I was 8, I had severe OCD episodes mixed with depression and anxiety. I’ve been using fluoxetine and depakane ever since this. Fast forward for my 28 years, I was in a secure place and my shrink said i had to drop depakene in order to get pregnant. 

In august 2019 I startes taking only fluxotine, and upped my dose from 20mg to 40mg. Then immediately after I stoped depakane, I started having severe panic attacks. My shrink them gave me clonazepam for the SOS moments, but they started getting frequent and severe, so he said to take everyday, 10 drops, which im still relutant of using because I know the severe effects that clonazepam can have. 

Since fluoxetine and clonazepam are still not effective for my phobia of diseases and panic attacks, my shink gave me a minor dose of aripriprazole, 1mg, for resistant depression, which im VERY relutanct of taking. I know it can be a prejudice, but in the spiral of medicines which I am, i can’t help it.

Today I thought I was with trombosis because my leg was numb, and had severe panic attack in the  hospital. Just from looking at the doctor, my heartbeat was 125bpm. Turns out it was again a anxiety crisis. 

I can’t live this live anymore. I feel legit I’m going to colapse someday. They said to me I have severe generalized anxiety disorder, but I can help but wonder that I’m bipolar (my dad and grandpa are) and because of my downfall after depakene was out of the scene.

"Interested in Molly, Shrooms, and Acid but have PANIC DISORDER","Hi!

I’ve had a really rough and complicated relationship to drugs as I am a genuinely curious person. Before I started getting panic attacks and derealization and health anxiety I was big into experimentation. However, now I suffer from weekly panic attacks and currently take lexapro 20 mg and Ativan 1mg. In highschool I tried coke, molly, ecstasy, shrooms, and weed. In college I tried acid but I was drunk when I took it and so I had a bad trip because I kept throwing up and was off my rocker. However I’m really interested in trying molly and acid again but because of my health anxiety and genuine fear of death I’m scared to take it. I am really curious though and all of my friends have had positive experiences on these drugs so I feel like there is a part of me that is missing out. I also recently derealized for the first time when I smoked weed a month ago and had a panic attack where I ended up calling 911 on myself. If I got such an extreme reaction to weed- are any of these drugs off limits? When will I be able to try them- and having my level of anxiety is it possible for me to reach a point in where I’ll be able to try them?

I have a form of anxiety that I can’t find much help for on the internet. Anybody have a similar issue that can help me?,"I’d say I’m an out going person with limited social anxiety in the moment and I’m pretty socially active. However, I have this thing I call reflection anxiety. Like I said I’m fine in the moment in social situations but when I reflect back on the interactions I overthink them and cringe at what I said or think they took what I said wrong. This happens almost everyday sometimes multiple times per day. I hate awkwardness so much. I think I’m pretty well liked and I know it’s all in my head but I can’t shake this anxiety. It’s almost like paranoia and I’m so tired of it. I think it probably comes from caring about what others think but they’re all people I care about.

Has anyone taken Buspirone HCL?,"Brief history of my encounter with medicine and anxiety. 

11th grade - had my first panic attack started taking medication (I forgot what because I wasn't fully paying attention to what was wrong with me) I was on edge all the time that I would skip school to relax about 2-3 times a week. 

Senior year - I stopped taking that medication because it wasn't helping and I felt like I was getting worse than better. 

From senior year until 4 years ago -  I was not taking any medicine for my anxiety and dealing with it through therapy, friends, family, meditation, all non medical treatments (it was going great for a while but I had another major panic attack that I ended up to the ER 3 times in the same month. 

2016 - taking Prozac made anxiety even worse was almost taken to mental health hospital. 

2017- present took mirtazapine to help me sleep because the Prozac really messed me up but it didn't help with my anxiety just my insomnia. 

Present day - new medication Buspirone. 

This is my first time taking this medication. I was told to take this medicine 3 times a day.  After the Prozac I have been afraid to try any new medication but I feel like it's crucial since I can't seem to relax and is always having triggers on the silliest things.

My anxiety is going to ruin something amazing,"So I am a female who is 22 and my boyfriend is 20.
We have been dating a month.

So, I just started dating him . I talked to him a whileeeee before we started dating though and I love him to death. However, my anxiety is really bad and all I do is sit in my head and think about things like, does he really love me? Or if he doesn’t respond for a few hours I wonder if he’s tired of me? I wonder if he thinks I’m annoying because of my anxiety too. I have tried to talk to him about it and I know most normal people worry about things like this, but these thoughts just consume me sometimes. 

He reassures me every time and tells me he loves me, but it’s like I don’t know. And he’s reassured me multiple times but at this point I don’t talk to him about it anymore because I’m afraid he’ll get tired of reassuring me for the same things over and over and that he won’t love me anymore 😥. So not talking to him about it also increases the anxiety I have. I believe he loves me, I really do. I’m just, I don’t know...worried he just suddenly won’t? Or that one day he’ll just stop? 

I literally love him so much. He’s my person. I’m pretty sure it’s the guy I’m supposed to be with for the rest of my life. But I don’t want my anxiety to ruin it, or to ruin my experience with him. I want to be present in the relationship and not worrying but I can’t make it stop and I want nothing more than to stay with him for a very long time. I don’t really know what to do at this point. I don’t want to come off clingy or needy but it’s like everything I do reminds me of him. I hear a funny joke and I’m like , oh! I have to tell him. Or I’m simply washing dishes and I remember a memory of us washing dishes together. It’s like even the little things. Everything. And on top of that, he has a new job working on a boat where he works for a month and then comes home for two weeks and then goes back for another month etc. and he starts Monday. I’m extremely stressed about that situation as well I’m afraid he’ll realize he doesn’t want me or he’ll enjoy being away from me.  But he assured me that he wants nothing more than to spend time with me and that he isn’t going anywhere. But I still and so worried. I know this was kind of everywhere but PLEASE tell me what to do. I can not lose him. He really is my person.

What do I do? I’m seriously at a loss as to how to go about handling this. I don’t want to be too needy and clingy by talking about my worries and how they consume me, but I feel like it’s something I should talk about, but it happens so often I don’t want to bring it up all of the time. It’s so lonely though not being able to talk about it every time. Then I’m just stuck in my head alone, and that’s almost worse. 

TL: my anxiety is consuming me with thoughts I can’t stop about my relationship. I’m finally happy for once and I don’t want to lose this guy. He is my person. I don’t know what to do",1580019452.0,0.81,3
Very strong fear and anxiety of going to community college as a foreigner,"My English isn’t very good and I’ve started having strong problems with fear and anxiety since I came to US.

Now I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life so I took the only advice that’s always been given me “go to community college and try some classes”. That’s what I did, I applied for community college and I start my classes next week. However, I simply get terrified, shaky, my heart starts racing, I start sweating and only bad thoughts of giving up and running off come to mind whenever I’m in a new class with new people and as a foreigner with limited English.

Progress (kinda) and still looking for answers. Young Sufferer...,"So not too long ago i’ve made a few posts about my anxiety and it’s symptoms. I’m 16 and a football player, after going into a winter break because i’m still in high school, towards the last week i had a THC-induced panic attack. I thought i was having a heart attack, and every time i tried again i was shaking in my room or with a family member sitting there until i calmed down and fell asleep. Because of this, i quit smoking. Due to injury and it being break i couldn’t workout at all, and i began to notice that when i suddenly stopped my daily routine, this brought about my panic attacks and anxiety, i always felt like i was having a heart attack or stroke, even though i’m sober and in decent heath, i still had them. I always felt like i was gonna lose my mind. My symptoms were:

-Shaking uncontrollably during panic attacks
-Sharp pains throughout my body (mostly chest and arms)
-Soreness without known cause
-Feeling of a lump in my throat
-Constantly tired
-Disconnection from reality (it didn’t take long for my girlfriend to notice something was wrong)
-CONSTANT feeling that i was dying
-Mood swings/irritability
-Hyperventilation
-Tension headaches
-Internal tremors
-Tingling/numbness in the face
-Sweating/hot flashes
-An actual SHOCK throughout my body, like when you get scared by something.
-A sudden cold wave (this actually feels pretty good)

After an EKG and an MRI, everything was normal. I’m waiting on bloodwork results. I found my solution once i started working out again, I needed let everything out of my system, and when i miss more than a day now i start to get the feelings again and immediately i’m back to feeling helpless.

Trapped in a State of Anxiety and Loneliness,"Hello to anyone who may take the time to read this,

I don't mean to victimize myself or try to share my full personal stories, but I must admit that I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for years and it comes to the point that it feels like it has consumed my life. 

It feels like a repetitive cycle from one fear to the next. I'll worry about my value as a person my morality or intelligence; then my own physical health to the point in which I've gone to specialists only to figure out my body is functioning normally.

Though I've had minor health problems in the past with no real distinctive issues; I know I've had family members who do and somehow I'm afraid these problems are to follow in me.

It's a crippling fear that I'm going to lose something; last summer my vision began to black out and I was terrified I was going to lose my sight; I've had fears of gaining an illness that would cripple me or developing a cancer that would make me lose my hair or at worse take my life. 

The worst of this though more than anything it seems is that fear of the future; a future were I'm left alone with no where to go to.

I suppose it's natural for me to want certain things; to find success and happiness with a group of close friends or a lover but those just seem like surreal fantasizes. I've lost three family members and two pets in recent years with many others living or moving out of state or out of the country. And it's made my fears more prominent than ever.

It hurts because even so there are a lot of family members around I have a hard time relating to. And I can't seem to find anyone I can relate to my age with my sense of social anxiety making it hard for me to approach anyone.  I've had literal dreams at night of joining competitions or events we're I've met and worked alongside new interesting people. As silly as it sounds I've had dreams of falling in love and walking beside someone while talking endlessly about the things we enjoy. Which only serve to make me realize just how awful this feeling of loneliness truly is.

I apologize for writing such a long post, and I don't mean to ramble too much; but I'm just hoping that I can reach out to someone who can help. Maybe somewhere like Reddit isn't the best place to express these feelings, but I figured it'll be a safe place to gain some sound advice and suggestions for how I can calm myself or find a way to meet new people who know what this is like.

Anyways, thanks in advance for taking the time to read this post; I sincerely appreciate it.",1580016299.0,1.0,1

Can I request a specific anxiety medication?,"I will be going back to therapy this week after taking a few years off. I’ve been prescribed almost every anxiety medication in the past, and I know what works for me.

I abruptly stopped my antidepressants a few years ago because of the side effects I was experiencing. I am overall doing great without them, but there are nights when my anxiety/ depression gets the best of me and it is hard to function. A rescue medication for periods of panic is what I would be asking for, and when it comes to asking for rescue medications it can look very bad. 


Could I explain this to a doctor as long as I show them past medical records so they don’t think I’m someone looking to abuse the medication I’m asking for?

Finally went back to the gym!,"For a little background, I've had problems in the past because of my irrational fear of having a heart attack or heart condition, despite being a young healthy person with no health problems, aside from asthma.
I'd already been going to the gym since last year, but stopped after winter holidays. I was about to restart the habit when my sister texted me saying that a woman had dropped dead in front of her while on the gym. It was on the news, she had a heart attack. (edit: my sister doesn't know how deep this fear of mine is, so she had no way of knowing this would affect me like it did). 
Since that day I've been terrified of the gym. Every time my SO suggested to go I feel like crying out of fear and make up an excuse, like being too tired or having a random organ ache.
Today I finally went, and it was honestly terrifying, since every time I felt anything at all I thought it was a signal of a heart attack. Despite all of that, I managed to complete my routine. I'll try again tomorrow, one day at a time.",1580014334.0,1.0,1

"Terrified about losing my new job, it means everything to me","It's impossible to really explain how much this means to me. Quick synopsis, I'm disabled and have been desperately trying to find one for 3 years. I finally (barely) pushed through the interview process. It was an unrelenting nightmare. I was on the verge of giving up again after 5 rejections, just like the two Christmases before this one. But I got lucky. I got the exact position I wanted at CVS. It's basically ideal. Problem is... My disability is already repeating itself. Just like it did at my first job where I was forced to quit. During the interview I was really upfront about having ""several medical conditions that can be alleviated with minor accommodations that would be handled independently"". I'm still struggling. Yesterday (first shift) it kind of realized a lot of my fears... I was extremely dizzy, disoriented, confused, light headed, had trouble communicating, made simple mistakes like neglecting to give the customer his items or not giving them a receipt. There were times where I wasn't even really conscious of what was happening. Just like at my last job. I'm going to ask for a stool to sit on which should help a lot with the vertigo... Hopefully my manager says yes, because it's necessary.

I'm just so afraid. My supervisors were really nice. I was just so dissociated from reality. Which I always am. I felt so out of place. Like I didn't belong there. I had trouble communicating with my supervisors as well... They just chalked it up to being nervous. Which really isn't the whole truth at all. But it's a convenient cover story since I'm new. I was kind of clinging on to my training supervisor a lot. Which I was really trying not to... I really was on another plane of existence for those few hours. For the most part of held my own though. Even if I did it in a very disorganized manner. I was enthusiastically greeting and saying goodbye to people which I was never able to do at my old job. So maybe some things did change.

I keep looking for affirmation that I won't be fired from my parents, therapist, etc. And they just tell me that's always a possibility. The anxiety is just eating me alive. This isn't just a job to me. In fact I don't even care about the money even vaguely. I wanted a place to grow and develop, instead of being locked indoors all day watching the seasons change from the interior of a dysfunctional household.

Strange odor when stomach muscles tense. Comes on suddenly and goes away just as quickly. 39M,"So I've been dealing with a weird byproduct of my anxiety for the last 7 months. When my stomach tenses from anxiety sometimes there's this strange odor that comes on very suddenly but goes away if I can relax my stomach enough. It's not sweat or a normal B.O. smell. I honestly don't know how to describe it properly. It's kind of like old stale air. It's fairly strong and obviously embarrassing when around others.

I've only been addressing my anxiety for about 10 months and have made a lot of progress by breathing and being more mindful. My stomach at the time was in a constant state of clenching to the point where I didn't even realize it was happening. Once I finally was able to finally relax the muscles and reduce my anxiety the frequency the odor occurred went down. I started Lexapro three weeks ago which really helped take a lot of the edge off and the odor was almost non-existent.

Unfortunately I just started a week long work trip and my stomach muscles have been clenching again and the odor is back with a vengeance. I'm working on keeping my anxiety in check but honestly I'm at a loss about what the source of this smell is.

I shower every day and am clean in general. My guess is it's something in my gut but I haven't been able to find anything about this online. My doctor has no idea and doesn't have much interest in figuring this out, focusing more on my anxiety.

I need help I don't know what's wrong with me.,"Just for a bit of an idea, I'm currently 15. So about a year ago, (around the end of the school year), I started worrying a lot about my health..sort of like health anxiety. I genuinely thought that I possibly had a brain tumor. I had full on panic attacks and worried constantly about it. That's when everything spiraled down. I began to have these awful symptoms. Nothing felt real to me..it felt like a dream. I was aware of this but I doubted my sense of reality. This happened nearly every day for the rest of summer and to this day, I'm still stuck with it but I've noticed a trend..I get these derealization/depersonalization symptoms everytime I go to a public  place that is busy. The odd thing about this is that this has never occurred to me, only after the constant panic attacks. I hate it.. I loved going to places and feeling like I'm truly present there with my family. I just want my normal life back. The real me..I want it back.

Switching from coffee to caffeine pills has oddly been helpful for me,"Ok ok, I know coffee makes anxiety worse. And I know caffeine pills may not help as much either. But after 2 weeks without coffee, I've found my anxiety to be less. Moreover, when I returned to coffee today it felt much more of that *deep down* anxiety. The type of anxiety that makes me feel paralyzed, and keeps me from leaving my bedroom and being productive. 

I started using caffeine pills since, honestly, I didn't want to stain my teeth but had to be awake early in the morning. Now, I'm thinking this is a better alternative. Of course, my anxiety isn't cured, but I didn't find myself getting as ""stuck"" like normal. Maybe coffee has been playing a role in my anxiety all along.

I didn't touch my phone so I quickly grabbed it to check if I accidentally did something and yeah... there was nothing and I didnt call him. 

So he answers the phone and the girl (almost like a pre automated msg in a way... like she had a script) started saying ""hey you're girlfriend asked me to call you"" and he's like ""what"" and she starts weirdly flirty giggling or something and then goes to say ""your girlfriend told me to call you so we can set up our... day??"" idk what she ended up saying at the end because he cut her off and just hung up.

The call log on his phone said it was my number that called.

My call log had nothing.

I phone my cell service and he's like meh it happens just its fake, and idk its just really weird that it would be off MY EXACT NUMBER and that the girl said ""your girlfriend told me to....""

"My anxiety is the worst it's ever been, and I'm struggling to cope.","To make a long story short, this started after I told myself it'd be better to go to a co-worker's New Year's party than stay at home. The closer it got to midnight the less people there I recognized which caused my social anxiety to spike. After midnight someone I didn't know got a handgun out to fire rounds into the air. Combine this with recently changing medications and I've found myself in a spiral of anxiousness and worry I've never felt before.

"I moved into a house with 9 other people. It's going great, but now I have a hard crush on my housemate and I don't know how to deal with it!

They knock on my door and are like ""Werliest, let's do stuff together."" It is never like school. Everybody is my friend in this house and none of my interests seem weird or boring to them. 

And then there is one guy: smart, crafty as hell and is basically a encyclopedia for random knowledge. He jumps into action, when he sees help is needed and cooks food like a chill Gordon Ramsay. 
He is always so calm and collected. 
I never met someone who likes all sorts mythology as much as I do, or can name random stars on the sky. We talked about Orion and what a jerk he is in greek mythology. Another time we took a 4 hour hike together and mostly just walked. Lovely silence. 

And he is so freaking nice to everyone, it is unreal. 

I like painting and we repainted his room together. While finishing the first wall I noticed I kinda feel good in his presence. I don't even feel the urge to talk to him to fill the silence. I started to hang around him even more and this feeling is now going beyond ""I like that dude"".

I am questioning my asexuality I accepted when I was a teen. I never cared for a dude before, now I just want to be close with him. I want to see him smile his gorgeous smile. 

Now, I have no idea, if he could possible like me back. I have self-doubt and can't judge my qualities, if I have any. He is also 6 years older than me. Maybe, he doesn't even see me as a woman, but a child. I don't want to ask him out, because we live together as housemates and things could get awkward.

Bailed on Plans,"Few things to unpack:

- I was laid off in July and have been struggling with motivation/self-confidence/depression/PTSD of finding a new job
- my husband and I keep our heads above water but in no way “comfortable”
- I’m uninsured and can’t afford therapy though previous therapists have diagnosed me with anxiety

I bailed on going to a concert with my husband, brother and SIL tonight. 

It started as I was trying to pick out something to wear and hated every outfit I put on. I used to do more shopping (recklessly) but have slowed that down. It was my release because I felt like I was in control of what I put in my closet and filled a void. Because I don’t have the funds to support that release, I’m trying to “shop my closet.” Ive also gained about 10 pounds since the lay off.

My hair didn’t do what I wanted it to either. I forced myself out the door to meet at my brothers and lo and behold he wants to show me this big camper they impulsively bought. It was so hard to feign interest and he makes a comment like “I knew you’d be late.” And I said “I didn’t even want to come.” And he and my SIL go “then don’t!” Ok way to make me feel like you want me to go?

My husband is non confrontational and tries to be supportive but this is his favorite band. I was left feeling SO GUILTY because all I wanted to do was go home but not at the expense of him missing out. 

I continue to decline and I finally explain it to my husband like” ...imagine I had a fever. You can’t just tell me to stop having a fever so we can go out.” He wishes me well and said he’s sorry I’m not feeling better. And then throws in “but this is my favorite band.” Selfishly I throw in “right because why would you choose your wife over your favorite band.”

I’m currently just sitting at my brothers house alone until they get back. I told my husband I was going to drive us back tonight (brother lives about ~45 min away and we planned on spending the night since we’d be drinking at the concert.) but that also low key triggers my driving anxiety.

I Get Scared Around People That I Sort Of Know,"Specifically dancing does it the worst for me, but doing anything outside of my comfort zone around people that I slightly know forces me to shut down and I immediately detach myself. Today, at my girlfriend's birthday, I had an anxiety attack. I was completely fine until they started playing games and that's when I felt a little out of place. But, when they started dancing, I freaked out. I couldn't even begin to force myself to do it. I HATE dancing with a burning passion. Everything about it. It's just so cringey and I despise every bit of it. So everything afterwards was immediately ruined because I was detached and I felt so out of place.

HOWEVER, this only occurs around people that I'm somewhat associated with. During the winter formal at my school I didn't even care because the people there didn't matter to me. I had no care for their feelings and I couldn't care less about how I looked, so I danced. But for some reason if I'm with my girlfriend's friends, I shut down. Something about the fact that I partially know them, makes me lost it. I could NOT force myself to do it.

If I don't want to do it, I'm not gonna do it. Nobody can make me do it. I just hate feeling like a jerk because everyone is pressuring me to do something and I'm not okay with doing it. I just want them to respect that can't do it. Ultimately, I want to just be able to enjoy those activities, but I can't foresee that ever happening. Does anybody have any advice?",1580003598.0,1.0,1

For everyone worrying about the coronavirus.,"Should we worry?

No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.

My insecurities are destroying my relationship and I really need help.,"First, in all fairness to me, I need to give some background. I didn't always have the most supportive parents. My dad regularly would call me things like ""worthless"" and ""hopeless"". He would make demeaning comments like ""girls won't like you if you don't go to the gym"" and ""personality doesn't matter as much as looks"". For reference as to why that hurt, I'm a runner. I have a runner's build. I'm not naturally muscular, I'm actually just lean. Then, all throughout high school, it seemed he was right. Girls never pursued me; it didn't matter how nice I was. They went after the jocks and the jerks that were more physically attractive than me but treated them terribly. It really hurt me. Bad. It did a lot of damage to my self-esteem. And then all through my first two years of college the cycle kept repeating. I even got close to a girl at one point and we flirted for a bit... and then she joined a sorority and wanted nothing to do with me. My entire life, women have treated me poorly.

Long story short, I finally met a girl that for the most part has treated me well. We've been dating since August. To my credit, at first, she was more brutally honest than she probably should have been. I was a virgin before we met and make the mistake of asking how I stacked up sexually to exes. And she mentioned that I wasn't as big and that I wasn't as good but I was getting better. That hurt. A lot. And even though since then she's done nothing but tell me how much she loves my dick, it's been an insecurity still. I had a sneaking suspicion that she preferred muscular guys too. So today I just outright asked her. And she answered honestly. She said ""Yes, I prefer muscular guys over skinny ones and if I didn't know you and I had to choose between a muscular guy and you, I would initially lean toward the muscular one on physicality alone. But I do know you, and I love you for who you are and you're perfect to me. I don't want you to change"". I get this, actually. I prefer short girls; she's as tall as me. At first, yes, it was a bit to get used to. But now I could care less because I love her. But rather than just... believing her and accepting what she had to say, I lost it on her. Completely. Without actually calling her this, I pretty much implied that she was a superficial bitch who only loved me because I was nice to her and that the minute some muscular guy came around who was as caring as I am, she'd dump me. That hurt her. Bad. We've worked it out, but it's probably the second or third time that my insecurities have damaged this relationship.

I don't know what to do. I need to work on this. I need to change but I don't know how. Help.",1579996696.0,0.91,1

How to email a teacher I don't know?,"I'll be a senior in high school next year, and I need an art credit to graduate. But, I am really bad at art, and I don't want to take an art class. Especially since if I take one now, I'll likely end up in a class with a bunch of freshmen who I don't know: anxiety central. But, my other option is to take AP Art History, which actually sounds interesting to me. I know I'm capable of taking the class itself and succeeding in it (I've taken 8 AP classes already, 2 of them being history-based). But, since I haven't taken a prior art class, I need the teacher to sign off on me taking it. The idea of having to email him to ask if I can take it and going to him to get said signature is giving me tremendous anxiety. How should I proceed?",1579993989.0,1.0,2
I went to a party and it actually went well :),"It was just a group of us drinking pretty much and I was really tired and riddled with anxiety when contemplating whether to go, thinking about it made me feel physically nauseous. It had been quite a while since I had been out drinking and I didn’t really know many people there. I decided to go eventually and I’m so glad that I did, it had been my birthday the day before (this wasn’t for my birthday) and I soon as I arrived everyone was really happy to see me and they all said happy birthday, and went on about how generous I was and how much of a good person I was, it was a real confidence boost and reminded me that I actually do have people who care about me after having a long period of being alone with anxiety and depression. Drinking admittedly made my anxiety way more tolerable but it’s still a challenge for me. This has been a very helpful reality check and just wanted to share :). I wish the best for anyone suffering from anxiety, and I think pushing against those anxious thoughts and just doing something that might make you anxious can sometimes be very beneficial <3",1579993806.0,1.0,6
Advice on finding a therapist,"How do I got about finding a therapist? I'm in the US, and I checked with my insurance, and they do cover therapy. However, when I called a couple of therapists near me, even though their websites advertise that they accept my insurance, they tell me that they stopped accepting insurance but that I can file a claim instead. I find that a little weird.

Also, what are the normal rates? What qualifications should I be looking for? How many sessions does it take figure out whether they are a good fit? Is there any website that will have reviews?

My anxiety is affecting my relationship,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over two years. 

Nowadays, when he touches me, my mind seizes up and projects vivid images of how he touched a girl he crushed on and slept with in the past. It leaves me with a terrible, debilitating feeling and I end up crying or self harming. 

About a year ago he admitted to texting her behind my back and that too had set off a series of depressive episodes.

I want to be a full-person and present for this relationship. When I’m not torn apart by my own mind, we get along great.

I don't know if I should go to therapy,"I go to counseling from my university for a few months now which is huge because I admitted that there is a problem, but now I am not sure if I should go further and try therapy or if the problems I face are just normal stuff people deal with. On some days I am totally convinced that everything is fine and in control and that I can actually live my life and be happy and successful and on some days I just know I will never ever accomplish anything in life and that I will have these thoughts about other people judging me forever.

I don't know. Here is a situation that may be a good example for my issues:

Two weeks ago I had to conduct a presentation. I used to love this in school, it was my favorite thing to talk in front of other people because I knew I was good at it. I am good with explaining and passionate about the things I talk about. But the last presentation in school was 3 years ago and I never had to do it at university until this one and to my own surprise it bothered me very, very much. One week before the presentation I had the first anxiety attack since April 2017. Then I went full work-mode for one week after a lot of procrastination (because this caused so much anxiety), I was so scared to fail and so scared that the mentor and the prof and the other students would be disappointed and I didn't want to let that happen. So the day came up and I barely slept the night. Right before it started another guy asked me ""So, do you do your proofs at the white board or do you use powerpoint?"" and I didn't know what to say because *I had not any proofs in my presentation*. I was so so scared and I already knew I failed, despite all the work I had put into this. But it was like I was on autopilot and I watched myself getting ready and putting my laptop there and everything and started talking. I spoke slowly to hide how incredible nervous I was and how little I had to say. While talking, I avoided looking at the faces of my audience, because I knew every single one of them was disappointed of me. I thought about every single person in the room and what my relationship with them was and how this presentation ruined it because it was so shitty. It should be 20 minutes but I think I only spoke about 12 minutes. When I sat down and watched the other presentations, I felt like crying. I should have felt relief, but I had to put every single bit of energy in my body to my eyes and my mind to prevent me from crying. I had failed so badly. Now everyone finally knew how dumb I really was.

So what's the point of this story? Well, I just got the mark for this presentation and it is a 1.3. That's the second best you can get. Wtf! The prof actually said when I left the room ""that was really good!"", but I thought he was talking to my friend also leaving. Now I can't help but think that he straight up lied because he felt pity for me and that this is also the reason for my in my opinion ridiculously good mark. At the same time, I feel like I could have gotten the best mark, if I just had put a little more effort in it.

Whatever, the reality doesn't line up with my experiences. It doesn't fit. People often tell me I am super intelligent and I think, if you look at it, I am objectively successful. I have a nice boyfriend, friends, a job, hobbies, I get okay marks. But I struggle to feel this. I always feel like it's not good enough. I feel like some day all the people will suddenly realize how stupid and incompetent I actually am and then they will feel betrayed and this makes me so incredibly scared.

A few months ago it got so bad that I actually couldn't go to university anymore which is the reason why I went to the counseling of our university. The man there is really great, he helped me realize what my problems actually are and gave some good advice on how to work on them. But last time he made it clear that he can not do much more appointments with me because there is a limit for each person. Also, I'd noticed that I got more and more anxious the longer the pause between appointments is (between 2 to 5 weeks). When I am not there for a longer time I feel like he secretly makes fun of me and my weaknesses. It always feels really painful to be so vulnerable in front of an almost stranger, but that got better because I started trusting him.

Before the last appointment, when all this presentation stuff happened, I finally convinced myself to go and start real therapy. But since then my mind changed again. Since I got such a good mark, it can't be that bad, right? I get my stuff done. I just have to trust myself that I can do it. I just have to take another point of view. It's not like some of you who can't leave their homes for weeks or who can't talk to other people. I can live my life, I do that all the time. Someone said ""If you have friends, you don't have social anxiety"", but what is it that I have then?

I don't really know what the point of this post is, sorry. Deep down I know that I need therapy, but I think I want some validation from you guys. Are there other people out there who have their lives going fine but still go to therapy?",1579992232.0,1.0,2
Not understanding what is triggering my anxiety?,"I have had crippling anxiety and depression in the past. I had a form of agoraphobia which left me terrified to leave my bedroom.

I had panic attacks and anxiety back then which gave me the shakes but I could usually cry it out and move on.

Been free of all that for about 3/4 years now, however these last 6 months or so I've started having intense anxiety/panic attacks. I'm incredibly happy, its certainly not depression. Work isn't stressful at all and I enjoy it. I have no pressure at home.

However, I'm getting panic attacks like I've never had before. I feel like I can't breathe, I get dizzy stood up, I feel like I'm sinking into the floor lay down. I went to the hospital once(felt like an idiot when they said i was fine it was a panic attack).

My huge issue with it all is I don't know why its happening. Theres no rhyme or reason. Just suddenly out of no where boom I feel like I'm going to die. Its awfully debilitating and I can't seem to get it to stop.

How do I figure out whats causing it? There's nothing on google for people who don't know whats triggering it, its all about stopping the triggers. I'm avoiding drugs like the plague and I feel like I've been to the doctors so much I'm wasting their time. I don't need a diagnostic, I need a cure.

Crippling anxiety,"Hey everyone! On May 4th 2019 I had my first ever anxiety attack. I have always had anxiety ever since I can remember, but never had a full-blown attack. It seemed to come out of nowhere. I was sitting at dinner with my fiancée, had barely eaten two bites of food and began feeling nauseous. Following the nausea came lightheadedness, and dizziness. After leaving the restaurant, things became worse. I felt like there was 1,000 lbs sitting on my chest, and my feet and hands became numb & I was shaking uncontrollably. At this point, I was totally convinced I was about to die. I had my fiancée take me to the ER and they ran some bloodwork and tests. After everything came back normal, they gave me fluids and sent me home. The following days were rough, I would have random bouts of anxiety and burst out crying. About a month later, I began getting even more symptoms which frightened me which is part of the reason I am here now typing this. Since having the panic attack, I get muscle twitching pretty much everywhere but it seems to happen more frequently in my legs. I also will get this weird burning sensation in my calf from time to time, and my legs and arms will feel super achy. I will also get numbness & tingling in my arms/hands. These symptoms come and go, but when they flare up they last about a week and then will go away for a month or more. I have went back to the doctor & my tests have come back normal. It’s just getting to the point where I am becoming super depressed and more worried all the time. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? If so, what do you do to relieve it?",1579990376.0,1.0,3
Calm long panic attacks that develop into a freak out panic attack?,"Here’s how these “attacks” happen:

1. Feel lightheaded already for unknown reason, relaxed while laying down
2. Brain will randomly pop/squish, feels like something needs to snap
3. My breath starts to get shallow and my brain starts to begin rumbling/vibrating
4. Start feeling sensation sensation I need to either get very angry, anxious or sad, but I calm myself
5. Honestly feels like lack of oxygen in brain, start to hold breath and it feels a bit better (less lightheaded)
6. Nostril gets stuffy on one side
7. Eyes start to feel strained and goes double/blurry and pressure builds on forehead, nystagmus starts
- eventually my jaw starts to spasm and my muscles get tight
- as pressure/vibrations builds, my eyes start to roll back into my head for short periods of times
8. Start to get fidgety and anxiety begins building
- start readjusting positioning/getting up/walking around, still feeling overly lightheaded
9. neck muscles relax and feels like slight relief, head still feels congested
10. Waiting longer period of time, start to hear crackling in my brain and feel more alert and less lightheaded, the more it crackles and pops the better I feels

Attacks usually last a couple hours if I don’t break it. If I want to break the episode short, I can do one of the following:
- strain my head immensely. Make a frown face like I’m extremely angry and my head will stop being as lightheaded
- let my anxiety get the best of me and get a real panic attack. I’ll freak out and my heart will race but I’ll stop being lightheaded and be able to think clearly afterwards l
- Get angry. Similar to the first point, I’ll strain my head and neck and feel instantly better
- Cry. I break out in tears and then my head will start to make weird noises and I’ll start to feel better.

Having trouble trusting psychiatrists and therapists + isolation,"Hi all, 


It's the first time I write in a group. I have OCD, I have dealt with significant depression episodes and I suffered from anorexia nervosa. Although I've been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember, this time is different. I've honestly never felt so isolated from others. I have a functional life, I'm happily married, I study and I work, I volunteer. But nevertheless I always feel like I'm more tired than other people. It feels like there is a wall between me and them, and that in reality I'm dysfunctional, and I'll always be. And healthy people cannot fully appreciate how hard it is to be anxious all the time. This goes on and on in my head constantly. So much so, that I started distrusting my therapist and psychiatrist on a visceral level. I feel psychiatry is a very hit and miss discipline, and I believe psychiatrists are basically drugs dispensers. It is probably important for me to say at this stage that I've had the same psychiatrist for many years and so far I've never had any reason for distrusting her. In fact I can rationally say that she has helped me lots. The same goes with my therapist. I feel that she has only read in books what my issues are, and that at the end of the day her job is to help me, but not completely, because I pay her. I live in Italy, where I must say that the general psychiatric care is not the best, but I've never had any reason to objectively doubt my health care network. I've been in emergency psychiatric care two years ago, with other doctors, and the experience has left me rather scarred. For one, they seemed to only aim to keep me as sedated as possible. The people I was hospitalised with did not get on very well with their lives (one killed himself, one became a prostitute and tried committing suicide multiple times, the other has full disability and goes in and out of emergency care, with no real life prospects in terms of social integration). It took me about a year to fully realize how bad that experience was. And from then I've started nearly hating psychiatrists. I also got into a weird bureaucratic loop after having been hospitalised, that makes it really hard for me to get and keep my driving licence. The medical panel that reviews my case has become the number one enemy in my head. And I fear that telling my therapist and psychiatrist how I really am could compromise me on the long term like having been in emergency psychiatric care. They could for instance write on my yearly report that I had some bad weeks, or that my anxiety levels are high, and that could result in loosing my driving licence. My husband says that I'm building it up in my head as an OCD obsession. Has any of you had similar experiences? ",1579988965.0,1.0,0
I can't seem to get a job and it's really sending me back into a downwards spiral.,"I'm nineteen, and for the past 8 months I have been unemployed. For about 3 of those months I was in and out of the hospital, getting a hold of my mental health, starting new antidepressants and anxiety meds. I started school for a vet tech certification, and although I'm sure it's not what I want to do anymore, I plan on finishing. 

I had a job at Burger King before I hit my breaking point, and honestly I loved it. I loved my coworkers, the customers, and everything the job entailed. I just need something with higher pay.

I've been applying for job after job, and I live in the suburbs of Chicago so it's not like there's a shortage here. I've had maybe 4 interviews and countless resumes and applications were sent. Most of the time, I don't even get a rejection letter. I had to sell my car because I couldn't afford to repair it, and now I can't even drive anywhere myself. It's so demeaning, and I constantly feel like a failure. 

I want to grow up, move out, buy my own car again, and have money.

It just really sucks because I finally feel like I'm back up on my feet emotionally, but I can't seem to do this one thing, you know? I'm scared of getting sucked back into that debilitating state of mind. Like, the sun is starting to set and the shadows are looming over me.

Constant shoulder tension & low-level headache?,"Hey! I don’t know whether this is caused by something being physically wrong with me or whether it’s related to constant stress due to my mental illnesses including generalized anxiety disorder and other mental illnesses. 

This has been happening since September of last year. I have them more often but my mental health has also declined since then. 

My shoulders are constantly tense and slightly sore. I don’t sit excessively and try to relax my shoulders but they are still tight. 

I have an almost constant, almost daily, low-level headache causing pain of probably 3 out of 10 on a pain scale, just an ache, in my shoulders, base of my neck, and eyebrows. It is sometimes on both sides of my neck and sometimes just one eyebrow and corresponding side of neck but which side it’s on varies. 

I have no other symptoms. 

I take between 1-4 ibuprofen or Tylenol, or a combination daily to prevent the pain from getting to a 5 or so. Sometimes the painkillers help and sometimes they only relieve the pain a little bit. My shoulders are still tense no matter what I take, hence the pain continues. 

I’m only 25 and have never had a shoulder injury. Should I be worried about this? I don’t have health insurance. What could cause this headache and do you think it’s caused by my mental health or by something physical? Do I have to go see a doctor about it???",1579982349.0,1.0,5

Instead, I embraced the panic attack and pulled through.","I've suffered from a severe panic and anxiety disorder since i was 11. I'm 21 now, still suffering but going to a clinic soon to fix it. My worst fears are trains, busses, public places, small space and being surrounded by many people. I had an appointment at my new psychiatrist and i had to take the train, luckily it was only 2 stations away, 6 mins or so. So I got on the train and i felt surprisingly well. I actually felt great. Then the train suddenly stopped between 2 stations and i was stuck inside, no way out. Well one way out, pressing the emergency button and prying the door open which would have probably gotten me in a lot of trouble with the police. Panic hit me immediately after the the train stopped, i couldn't breathe and i felt like passing out any second. I got up and walked to the door and checked to see where the emergency button is. I actually considered pressing it. But the feeling of passing out completely overwhelmed me and i sat down on the floor and took deep breaths and tried to relax as best as i can. and guess what? It worked!! I survived the panic attack, i pulled through it and it feels f*cking amazing!! It gave me new hope and i actually believe that i'm able to overcome it. If you read everything, thank you!

My very anxious husband constantly believes I dont love him,"My husband struggles with social anxiety, depression and Generalized anxiety. I suffer with generalized anxiety.
My husband drinks almost daily and smokes. When he drinks sometimes he gets very upset and says that I dont love him and that if I dont love him I should leave. I do love him and i dont understand how he doesnt see that.. maybe i express my love differently than he receives it. I was thinking about trying out the 5 love languages. I think that showing my love is by doing service to him. I go above and beyond to try and make things easy for him, and the rare time he helps me out with household chores (I am a stay at home mom, so I dont mind doing the brunt of it), I am super appreciative of it.

He has said he tried medication when he was younger and had suicidal thoughts with them.. he thinks a psychologist will think he is crazy and try to take his kids away or something (which is pretty far fetched since he is an amazing father). He never wants to talk about any feelings and is very hard to read since he has been hiding emotions like a professional his whole life. He had a really rough childhood.

I just dont know what to do. I am thinking of getting him to go to a counselor, and me as well, and then have couples counseling too so we can learn how to help eachother.

I do care for him a lot, I think I still love him.. I just haven't felt that emotional connection for a long time as hes been going down the rabbit hole and constantly telling me that I dont love him and constantly having to explain that i do. 😭

How to deal with people who treat you like a child because you still live with your parents?,"I'm a 28 year old women, at the moment I live with my parents as I haven't been able to move out with my boyfriend yet. I was down the pub a few hours ago just having a drink to interact with some people I haven't seen in a while. In the evening I mention oh my tea will be ready at 5, il have one more drink. Then when I go to get another half the land lady says "" are you sure you're aloud to drink anymore? I don't want your dad having a go at me"" and I said he only said not to serve me a few years ago because he was using the fact I take lamotrigine as an excuse. I start arguing that I'm 28 I'm only focal epileptic and I've only had anxiety problems and I start saying if I didn't live with my parents would you be still treating me like this? It's funny how I've been served before this despite one time one person claiming they won't serve me alcohol because dad said so. They may as well bar me, it wasn't the fact id drank to much or was being disruptive they just over heard me say my tea was ready and decide to use what my dad said two years ago against me. I actually believe they are using the fact I have hypocondroplasia against me to dictate how much I'm aloud to drink.

Despite living at home I've had my own life experience and I started crying about my misscarrage I had 2 years ago to the person who was moaning that I shouldn't have another drink if tea ready. Which right now I wish I didn't start crying. He even got my mum to collect me! 


How do I deal with the situation if my dad goes in there and hears what had happened? Do I just say oh well they shouldn't be using something like "" oh my tea is ready"" to bring up what you said years ago.

Going through a very unwelcome spell of anxiety; here is how I am dealing with it currently.,"I hope this posts acts with dual purpose.  One, to verbalize and name some of the stuff that's been messing with me over the past week or so seems to always help.  Two, hopefully individuals who suffer some of the same symptoms can get some relief in knowing that its not just you, and your not crazy!  I have been on a hot streak of no anxiety for quite a long time.  Hitting the gym every morning, having fun at work, being social, etc. etc.  ENTER LAST FRIDAY.  For whatever reason, I had an anxiety attack that knocked me off trajectory, and has sent me spiraling ever since.  It started with a jacked up heart rate, and a dizzying feeling (like the weak feeling you get when you don't eat for a while). . . that's all the bait my mind needed, and took it from there.  I am not going through all the typical daily anxiety things; constantly checking my heart rate, constant cardiac awareness (what was that bump in my chest just now!!!??), hyper vigilance (body always tensed up waiting for ""something"" to happen), and as of yesterday I have been experiencing hypersensitivity to jarring movements and noise (this one I really hate).  The odd thing is, I have experienced each of these symptoms 100 times before, and know without any doubt that its a result of anxiety. . . so why then can I not just dismiss them?  Anyway, as it typically does, it has interfered with my ability to exercise (terrified of my heart rate going up uncontrollably), sleep pattern has been messed up, constant pressure/headache, neck pain and soreness, sore muscles (most likely from the constant muscle tension I am subconsciously putting them in).  

However, I took an approach today that seems to have provided a measure of relief and perspective.  I pulled out my journal and back tracked every-step/symptom/event/trigger over the last 8 days that led me here.  Narrowing down the exact causes of what triggered my anxiety.  Not sure why its comforting, but just identifying it seems to give me a bit of control over the situation.  Also, writing it down and naming it gives me a bit of control/power over it as well.  Hope everyone is doing okay, hang in there.  Something I have found that helps me tremendously when I am having anxiety (particularly the variety of hyper sensitivity) is to log onto MINECRAFT and build/create something.  I suppose this would work in any creative canvas.  Also, make a plan to stay busy and stick to it; no matter how much you may not feel like doing it in the moment.  Idle hands are the devils playground when it comes to anxiety.  The anxiety portion of your brain will run circles around before the logic portion has a chance to put its pants on.   Keep your mind busy!  Good luck and god speed all!",1579975536.0,1.0,0
I reported a discord 'predator' and now I feel bad (sexual abuse tw),"In my little online community there's been a person whom everyone has been aware was 17/18 and dating a 13/14 year old (they both had birthdays during the time they dated). They've had sexual conversations. 14 year old seems convinced this was all their fault and responsibility despite others trying to assure her it wasn't.

The then-17 year old has also convinced other children to let her hack into their account so she can sneak into servers she was banned from for her behaviour, and threw a jealous temper tantrum when she discovered both an 11 and 14 year old were getting friendly with the 14-year-old girlfriend, expressing a desire to warn the other two kids away. 

&#x200B;

Now, this 18 year old is no longer dating 14 year old. But last night I discovered the rest of what happened (eg the conversations of illegal natures and hacking), and got so angry that I reported her to Discord with evidence of what she's done. 

&#x200B;

I'm feeling pretty bad now. It's a cliché but if discord chooses to report this to authorities, I worry I've just ruined this 18 year olds life. When I told my mum I reported her, she said she wished I'd stay out of other people's conversations.

"Finally, a pleasant experience!","So yesterday at my school, I was being harassed by this dude that’s been known to harass a lot of people for no reason. I’ve had troubles with him in the past, but I guess he just exploded. He basically got angry cause I said “no thank you” and “please leave me alone” to him when he was trying to give me a pen. This caused him to start yelling, cussing, and telling me phrases like “you’re gonna be the reason I’m depressed” and personally attacking me and my friend, who had tried to get him to stay away from me before. It was pretty scary. This caused me to have a panic attack, but there’s a good side to this, which is why I’m writing this now.

People could tell I was really upset after that, and they actually did something about it. I got a note from people I don’t know too well comforting me. People in my classes knew what was up, and tried their best to calm me down, despite it taking me ~1 hour to just stop tears and snot from flowing. My friends helped my make a report to the staff at school, and they’re investigating that dude more now.

It was because of this bad experience that I came to the realization that my peers do actually care about my existence, a concept that I have struggled with all my life due to mental illness. I actually felt.. loved? When my peers told me that they loved me yesterday, it actually felt ‘genuine’. I now hold them to the highest respect that I have ever had with anyone.

Dull headache,"

Hi, 
Around one month ago I was walking to get on a train to travel to a football match and as I went downstairs I felt a rush of blood to my head. I felt very dizzy and began to get very anxious. It overwhelmed me at the time it took place. I went and got on the train which was very busy with other football fans and I managed to get a seat. I was with my friends who notices I had gone pale and I was fearing the worst. I started to have heart palpitations and felt a feeling of impending doom. I then went to the game and could barely focus on the game still feeling dizzy and strange. My thought process had changed from enjoying the football to thinking about making it through the football game without dying. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life. However, I did make it home for the football and spoke with my parents who felt I had had a panic attack. That night going to bed I read for about an hour many reasons for the feeling the symptoms I felt and made myself paranoid about having many diseases. I have always had a fear of death but had never thought about it as much as I did that night.
The next morning I was attending university and was having chest pains and heart palpitations and I felt like my heart was racing. I then again thought I just had to make it through university without dying and get home. I was then on edge about my health for the next week. I came down with a flu around Christmas time which I had accepted was normal as a few members of my family also had it. This flu meant I spent a week in bed but as the flu went away I was left with a dull feeling in the back right hand side of my head. I have now faced the fact I am struggling with a phase of health anxiety and convinced myself it was a tension headache rather than a brain tumour which I was fearing. On Christmas Day the feeling was present and I wasn’t feeling completely better but I went out drinking with my friends and I could feel pain in my neck which I put down to the fact I had been in bed for the past week and it was probably weak and not used to being upright. I convinced my girlfriend to leave with me and go home as the dull pressure feeling in my head was present. However I was also very anxious. This feeling persisted and I went and seen my gp who asked me a series of questions regarding it. He basically worked out that I was struggling with health anxiety. He told me it would go away and is probably a sinus headache lingering from the flu which can take 2 weeks to clear. It is now a month later and my anxiety is still pretty bad and the feeling in my head has persisted. The feeling is unexplainable, I can’t figure out if it is mentally in my head and I just think I am feeling this sensation. Or if there is actually a feeling of dull pressure in the back right hand side of my head. My neck has also been cracking very frequently and I feel like my right ear may be feeling pressure too but I am unable to tell if it is in my head with my anxiety. I am going to see my gp again on Monday as I am fearing the worst for it and am wondering if anyone could help me know what this may be or if they think it sounds mental. I have no other symptoms with this feeling no sickness forgetfulness none of the usual tumour symptoms that come up online just this strange feeling in my head. I also have no history of rumours in the brain in my family and I have not had cancer before.",1579972823.0,1.0,0

Currently in the middle of a health anxiety panic attack!!!!!!!,"Ugh okay so I'm FREAKING OUT because I woke up with sharp, persistent, intense leg pain on the side of my calf on left leg. I've convinced myself I have a blood clot, and I'm trying so hard to rationalise my thoughts. The problem with this particular thought is imminent death (unlike say muscle pain or cancer) so I find it hard to ignore because what if I'm right. 

Back story:

I've had health related anxiety for as long as I can remember. It's always something that will instantly kill me with no warning (usually heart/brain related), so I freak out intensely until I end up in hospital and feel stupid. The anxiety ended up spilling over into other things so I was on medication for 3 years which I recently stopped for 3 months, then started on a smaller dose again 5 days ago.

The problem is that I feel like I'm going to die like right now and I don't know how to stop being so scared!!! I haven't had a health related panic attack for years so I feel really pathetic right now. Has anyone else been through this and been totally fine?? I'm so scared.",1579971437.0,0.92,5
Question: anxiety and disability,"I’d much rather NOT go this route, however I pay child support etc, I’ve been unable to keep a job due to frequent anxiety attacks. I take Xanax daily.

As we all probably know, you don’t pay child support, you end up in jail. I don’t want to feel like a bum and want to contribute to society, however I can’t maintain a job for very long due to this. It’s also embarrassing, the stigma that you’re nuts if you have anxiety. Would this enable me to get disability? I really don’t want to do this, but I’m running out of options. Thanks.

This Wuhan Coronavirus has me doing so many irrational things because I’m convinced I’m going to get sick and die,"Everyone says that because I’m only 22 I have a small chance of dying from the novel Coronavirus.  My anxiety filled brain cannot stray from irrational, intrusive, catastrophic scenarios. 

I’m an alcoholic, I don’t exercise and I smoke BUT I’m at a healthy weight,  eat enough with vitamins, have no preexisting physical conditions  and drink enough water so my chances of dying are more unlikely than they are likely. (I think?) 

But as ALL of you know the presence of anxiety can create irrational fear but your brain will always come up with ways to rationalize the irrational. 

I’m just so paranoid and can’t shake the idea of death despite being suicidal. Which doesn’t make sense. 

Maybe the idea of dying from a virus that has no cure that I can’t see and can’t predict is more scary (despite college education in biology) than dying of bipolar, anxiety, BPD, alcoholism, and depression because suicide is an act done by me and my choice (even though mental illness which is a REAL DISEASE OF THE BRAIN would be masking me into suicide).

My anxious friend's lack of autonomy worries me,"As the title says, i have a friend that suffers from anxiety, mainly social anxiety. Like, say we go out to eat, he is scared of asking for ketchup or salt or something like that to the waiter/waitress so he asks me to do it. Or maybe he asked me to accompany him to go buy something and now hands me the money and asks me to pay for him.
Which i do, but should i?

My thought is i should tell him to do it himself because i feel like he needs to be able to do these insignificant actions (which do not feel insignificant to him, i know) and i am not doing him a favor by always doing it for him. I have social anxiety as well and have been working on mine, i joined a really social student association from my university and it was HELL for more than a year but now i can look people in the eye when they talk to me/talk to them or say hi without nearly having a stroke. 

I know every person is different and the fact that i had some autonomy and was able to take the step of working on my anxiety by myself may show that mine isn't as severe as his but it still feels... wrong(?) to see him struggle so much with such things

I’ve been suffering with really bad panic disorder recently and when I get panicky I get pain in my chest, more to the left side and my mind keeps telling me the pain is in my left breast, where the lump is. 

Ever since I’ve been suffering with panic disorder I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve cried and worried and everything about it but I’m too embarrassed to ask a family member to take me to a doctor, but I’m too anxious to go to a doctor on my own.

I don’t know what to do. My mind is telling me I have cancer but I know it’s not likely in a way and I’m so scared I can’t even function.

Someone please help me or advise me on what to do. I can’t do this anymore it’s impossible to live like this anymore",1579960054.0,1.0,11
Partner came out as poly and have been in panic ever since,"My digestion has been on hault ever since my partner said that they (non binary) think they are poly. 
To be honest, i don't even know what is making me panic this hard. They said it didn't change anything and nothing would happen without my consent and even said that they wouldn't mind being monogamous... It was just that they had to tell me because they felt like they were lying to me whenever they felt connected emotionally to someone.

I just don't know what to do to calm myself in this, i love them with all my heart I just don't know if my head can go around this.

Dating with anxiety,"I’ve just started dating someone I really like and I keep thinking about ending it due to the anxiety it’s causing me. 

As a back story, I was married for ten years. Everything that went wrong in our relationship was apparently due to my anxiety. I ended up leaving him after having two kids and my anxiety was pretty much gone.

I then started dating someone who was very controlling and abusive- and whilst he was very giving with his feelings he was also a textbook DV candidate so I came to my sense and left before it escalated.

I’ve been back in the dating game about 3 months. I’ve had a lot of flings and didn’t want anything serious, however I have caught some serious feelings. 

He’s great, and a really nice guy. I can acknowledge that even if he doesn’t want more from me, he is genuinely not messing me around. He also has a very similar relationship path to me. 

When we’re not together, it’s so good. When we’re apart, I’m a bit of a mess. I’m convinced he’s not interested although he’s done nothing to suggest that, quite the opposite in fact. But I can’t help but feel like I’m a huge burden on his life. 

I honestly haven’t felt this way about anyone since my ex husband, and I’m a mess. I keep thinking I should just end things to save myself, but from what I can’t tell you.

Any pointers as to how I get through this? I just wish I could acknowledge that what will be will be, but I can’t! It’s honestly so flipping hard! 

TLDR; started dating a nice guy after 2 abusive relationships and it’s peaked my anxiety like crazy!",1579958882.0,1.0,0

So my Great Uncle died yesterday.,"Im 30, in Florida if that matters. When I was told, it was not a huge surprise. He had been sick for a bit, in and out of hospitals and whatnot. I had a really nasty 24 hour bug complete with a fever over 102 and hadn't started eating yet, at that point 48 hrs and counting, and was dealing with a tinder guy turning sour when I decided to turn him down. I was sad but okay with his passing. A few hours later getting out of the bath I realized I was short of breath and it was minorly painful, thought huh, must be pulled muscles from ralphing yesterday and went on my merry way. Then when I woke up short of breath my first thought was, crap, inhaler is in the car, I don't wanna get dressed to get it. I do a few deep breathing exercises and realize I CAN breathe, I'm just not using all my airways subconsciously. I can also breathe fine sleeping, it's the dull ache that woke me up. Then it HITS me: This is my response to death. When my Gramma passed this (but worse) was my response, long and drawn out for weeks until I was put on antianxiety meds for the first time. I don't have those anymore and I'm no longer panicking at 'not' being able to breathe, but I would really like to stop the pain I cause myself to feel as it is like a 3-4 on the scale and I'm more comfortable being shirt of breath than most peoplei think because of being an asthmatic for the majority of my life.

Need some guidance for my father...,"We lost my mother this past weekend, she passed away on Sunday. It was something we all expected. She was over 8-10 years diagnosed with severe dementia/FTD type dementia. In September of last year she developed pneumonia after a bout with the flu, developed dysphagia, and between then and. Ow was on a severe decline. She lost around 80lbs. Developed a stage 4 bed sore, which we couldn’t get under control due to her advanced ailments. In the end she passed under the care of nurses and my father in the home. She spent around 3 days dying, breathing slower and slower as she was dosed on palliative morphine, and when she did go - my father was holding her hand and hugging her. 

He had been her caregiver for years. Since her diagnosis. A life change, and in the last 6 years, every few hours at night - up to support and change her. Laundry of bedsheets, changing of incontinence garments and pads. Her every waking need as dementia took her further from us all. 

Now after a decade of being her rock, and the better part being her only means of survival, she has passed. My father has had full on panic attacks multiple times since her passing. One of them I had him rushed to the ER as he had extreme stroke like symptoms (Tuesday - the day of her funeral). When paramedics were tending to him, he had a full on seizure. We stayed overnight, and since it is a small town - the ER doctor was also the one who watched over my mom and knew of his ordeals. He was given an RX for Ativan, 1mg sublingual as needed twice per day. If I recall we have used about 5 pills from weds until now. 

My dad has had some pretty vivid dreams or lucid states where he was calling for my mother, and asking for help to find her, because someone took her. Why isn’t she home, did my sister have her? Call your sister, see if she has seen mom. He even asked me while on an Ativan dose of “she was in there?” Pointing at the screensaver of our roku on their TV. There was a light on, so maybe she was there? Can you check?

These dreams are haunting. He hasn’t slept in his bed in over 4 months, ever since she hasn’t been able to. I am sleeping on his couch while he sleeps in his lazy boy. I want to help him, but I am not an emotionally drawn person. I simply don’t have the same reactions, and I don’t know how to calm him. I am here away from work for a few weeks, but I live out of country. 

Sunday, I have found and booked us for a visit with a specialist in mental health and I have a few videos of his attacks to share. What I am looking for is help/guidance on what questions to ask the doctor (psychiatrist I believe, won’t know till we are there). What is pertinent? My dad has suffered the rocking of his world. His only purpose for living has died. My mother is gone, and he is having some seriously challenging feelings of not doing enough. That he didn’t help her enough. The strongest man I know has fallen to his knees and I need help to pick him up.

Having anxiety disease is terrible and i'm tired of having it ...,"Hi i'm a 27 guy with several years of anxiety in his body.

It started several years ago,when i'm starting to be too much aware about my body.I went to several medical checks(Brain,Heart or other stuff.) all with negative results,so i was reccomended by the doctors to go to  a psychologist  to solve my problems.

The psychologist discover easily that my problem was social anxiety,since i have an avoiding behaviour on doing things,and also  hypochondria ,which make me so scared of even doing physical activities.

After a pair of years of threatment,i resolved my problems,with also mindfulness exercises, and 2018-2019 were my best years in term of socializing,having fun,and be happy of my self,also i found a girl that she love me so much.

But from the fall of 2019,my anxiety went back and even stronger than before;i'm still going to my psychologist and he is still helping me to pass through it again,but it's seems like that  is not having any effect to me.

I think one of the main reasons is that year will be probably different,i went to Germany last week to start my internship and i almost finished my master degree,so i am almost a guy who is starting to have many responsabilities on my shoulder.

So from October,when they said to me the data from the internship,i started to have several manifestation of my anxiety:Pain in my chest,Mind getting fogged,Irritable skin when i'm getting nervous and so bubbles in all my body that make me scared to do physical activites,Obsessive thoughts(Like OST or songs that destroying my brain) and fear of sleeping(feeling like i didn't sleep when i wake up)

I'm so pissed off,i don't want to live like this.it's ok to having anxiety for some things,but those ones are really not necessary and don't let me to enjoy the life and having fun as i did last year,even in moments of relax i feeling those pains,also now when i'm writing this i'm feeling very anxious.

And also  leaving alone until march make me scared of all the things. :(

Sorry forthe long(at least to me) post,but i need to throw out all the things in my mind .",1579948578.0,1.0,1
Anyone else find that poor eye sight is an anxiety trigger?,"Does anyone else find that poor eye sight is an anxiety trigger? Depending on the distance, a persons facial details can be extremely blurry to me (as with most things that have detail, such as letters, numbers, etc...) When someone is close enough to me, I can make eye contact, but if they’re outside of a certain distance, (not very far), I have trouble trying to maintain looking in the direction of where eyes are, because I can’t tell if they’re making eye contact still, or what their facial expressions are really doing. This makes me feel very awkward, and I can feel my voice start to get lighter, because I don’t want to make weird or uncomfortable eye contact; I just can’t see. I know the solution to this is to wear glasses or contacts, but I wonder if anyone else experiences anxiety due to a lack of a sense?

Also, I have another anxiety trigger when a person sitting next to me instead of in front of me tries to have a conversation. I have a hard time speaking confidently without feeling self conscious, when a person is sitting next to me.

"Can’t sleep, reassurance would be greatly appreciated.","Am on mobile and panicking, sorry for format and any mistakes. 

Roughly 3-4 years ago I developed a rather specific fear of losing my sanity to the point of being comparable to severe dementia where I just lose myself. No idea what this stems from but it interrupts my every day life. I’m also very scared of dying. These 2 issues are not a fun combination. 

The slightest feeling of anything less than normal sends me into a downward spiral of panic that I’m dying and, while logic tells me that I’m not, it also makes me question my sanity since I truly think I’m dying. It’s a really vicious cycle that constantly has me scared to try new things due to the possibility of it being what finally sends me over the edge. For example, I (27m) won’t go to haunted houses because I’m worried it could scare me so bad that it changes my perception of reality and send me into psychosis. I won’t take any type of narcotics (this includes klonopin) for the same reasons, I worry the “buzz” will alter my perception of reality forever and I’ll never come back. 

I’ve noticed a lot of these concerns have one thing in common and it’s that they’re triggered by “what if” questions. I’m a “would rather be safe than sorry” type of person but this is too much and I don’t know how to fix it. It keeps me awake nearly every night because I jump at the first hint of falling asleep due to “what if I don’t wake up”. 

I’m starting to wonder if the anxiety itself hasn’t already sent me into psychosis or caused some other sort of mental disorder. Maybe my perception can’t be changed and this is just my life now? What if one day I have a panic attack so bad that I don’t come back and I end up in a psych ward forever? <<<This right here is my number one biggest fear. It makes me anxious about the anxiety that I know is coming and when it does come it hits twice as hard because “this is the one I won’t recover from”. 

Can anyone else relate? Is this a common anxiety? What do I do? Therapy isn’t helping. I feel like it’s only a matter of time before my fears come true and I’m lost in my head forever.",1579941853.0,1.0,1

anxiety making me too anxious to go to therapy,"Hey guys, my biggest struggle right now is basically the tagline: I’m having severe postpartum anxiety related to illness (flu, RSV, and coronavirus in particular) that is making me too afraid to go almost anywhere, including a therapy/psychiatry appointment. 

I had generalized anxiety and panic disorder prior to pregnancy, quit all my meds while pregnant, and was essentially in remission. It was like a switch turned off for the most part, which was great. However, I’m 6 weeks postpartum and am absolutely petrified of me or my baby in particular getting sick. If I have to leave the house at all (i.e. to grocery shop) I do it in the dead of night to avoid crowds and get home and strip off my clothes immediately and then wash and sanitize my hands, arms, clothes, cell phone, door knobs, etc. 3-5 times before I’m relieved. I won’t touch any groceries until they’ve all sat for more than 6 hours and I’m convinced any lurking viruses are dead. I’ve never been like this before but can’t shake it and was wondering if anyone else has had this and what they did? 

I can’t imagine having to sit in a therapist’s office knowing a sick person could’ve been breathing/coughing/sneezing on the couch minutes before me.

 After that I sorta just spiraled, now I'm here thinking about everything to falling asleep at a party to how much of a bad person I am to family matters to wondering why it was surprising I complimented myself. 

It's sporadic worrying about everything, what I wrote down are just some of the ones I could remeber off the top of my head, this has had me close to tears a few times tonight and I really just hate this. 

In any case, enough with the self loathing! I was curious could something as ridiculous as my girlfriend getting upset and then not talking to me for a small bit be enough to send me over like that? Or I guess a better thing to ask is, is it normal? 

Thank you for your time

Anxiety and Panic Attacks Began at 3 Years Old,"As the title says, I've had intense, almost constant anxiety every day since I was 3 years old. I vividly remember panic attacks, thinking my mom was going to die whenever she left me at daycare or with my dad at home.

I'm 26 now. While I've improved greatly, the anxiety is still there, and it's something I battle almost daily.

Anyway, I'm just wondering how common my experience is. Most people I talk to who also have GAD, it didn't start until at least puberty or their early 20s.

And, FWIW, my mom says that I was an anxious, clingy baby. I would cry incessantly when she wasn't near. That's normal baby stuff to an extent but, compared to my older brother, I was very needy.",1579936571.0,0.67,3
I want to socialize more but I'm surrounded by bad people all of the time. Anyone grew up in a bad neighborhood?,"Hey, long time lurker here. I've been dealing with social anxiety throughout my childhood. Not to go into too much detail, but I live in a \*sigh\* ""ghetto"" area. Now, being in junior year in high school, I came to realize I've always chosen small groups of friends to socialize with in school. I was the very quiet kid that didn't like being having to be involved with the assholes at my district because they were always up to trouble. I'm very observant of everything around me. When you're dealing with negative thoughts everyday, and surrounded by toxic people enforcing those thoughts everyday, it's like a barrier.

I'm working towards building myself by wanting to socialize, but I'm stuck between having to hang out with those who don't value me as much and remain in my comfortable space with a few friends. The town is full of untrustworthy people and probably the reason why I'm anxious about my surroundings.   
Anyone else have the same problem? I've searched but the results don't match mine.",1579936562.0,1.0,0
How do you quell irrational fears that everyone is watching you?,"As the title speaks, I've been having a constant nagging thought whenever I'm not alone, that everyone is watching me.

Do you have this range of symptoms ?,"Hey everyone,

It's been few years since I struggle with anxiety and I guess my anxiety cause a lot of physical symptoms which tend to contribute to anxiety you know the circle...

And weirdly enough, I get crazy anxiety with the people close to me. I dont feel as anxious with people I barely know it should be the other way.

Anyway I really need your help on this one because I'm getting mad.

In the morning, I am really comfy in my bed but after waking up like 10-15 minutes, I start to feel very tense, cold hand and feet and I have a sort of sensitivity to cold and pain. I start to yawn excessively. It is very uncomfortable. My chest area feel ""restless"" and I have a strong urge to move to ease this discomfort. Its very hard to describe like I dont even know how to say it.
If I'm in a hot tub, this feeling disappears.

It always get better at night, and I start to feel comfortable enough to sleep.

Self-Help Books?,"I thrive on reading self-help books, but I'm not in a financial situation that allows me to buy tons of self-help books dedicated towards understanding my anxiety and how to manage it. I want help and advice. If any of you found a book particularly helpful, I'd appreciate your recommendation. The last few weeks have been tough, and I want to nip this in the butt before it progresses into something worse (like my anxiety has done in the past).

It comes in waves for me. I can go a year or two with manageable anxiety and then I'll get smacked in the face with debilitating symptoms that persist for months or longer before I am able to rein them in again. Self-imposed cognitive-behavioural therapy is what I'm relying on for now.

I do not have insurance either, so professional help is out of the question right now, unfortunately (if I can't afford purchasing more than a book or two, that should tell you enough about my financial situation that I cannot afford to foot the bill on therapy, sorry).

I work out 5 or more days a week to keep my head clear. You all have recommended me this in the past (thank you, by the way). If my symptoms continue to worsen, I'll probably end up cutting out caffeine as well; I can't manage both my burgeoning anxiety and high caffeine intake at the same time despite my love for that morning cup of joe.",1579930813.0,1.0,2
TW: Gender Dysphoria | I'm having a lot of trouble making myself go to eat.,"Some backstory:   
I went through a lot of counseling in high school, and it was very helpful. I learned a lot of coping and self-improvement skills that still help me. I've moved away to college for the last few semesters, and things have gotten way worse for my anxiety. Crowds and noise are my biggest triggers, and this place is full of those. Sitting in a quiet, secluded place is my best way to calm down, and that's all but impossible here.

The worst part is the dining hall. The only place to get a full meal close to me is a gigantic buffet style dining hall. The food's decent, the place itself isn't bad, but the crowds are horrifying. Hundreds of people walking, standing, talking, looking and laughing, it's so difficult for me to deal with that. There aren't many corner seats either, so I usually end up sitting near the middle of a section with about 100 people in it. It's hard enough to convince myself that the one person I hear when I'm walking outside isn't laughing at me, let alone 100 laughing people. But anyway, I made it through (many panic attacks later). It was painful, but not unbearable.

Then I realized that I was trans, and my mental health tanked. All of a sudden the voice inside my head went from, ""Why did that girl look at me? She must think my face is hideous; she's right it is hideous."" to ""Why did that girl look at me? She must think my face is hideous; she's right it is hideous. My face will never look like a real girl's face; I'll be stuck in this ugly manly body for the rest of my life."" And I use counter thoughts, and I logically know that those things don't follow, but I can't help but feel terrible afterwards.

Flash forwards 5 months and we reach today. I've sorta half transitioned, in that I stopped using my old name and pronouns, and I've gotten things to the point where I don't feel too dysphoric about anything but my face. My face, however, is unbearable for me to look at. I even hate brushing my teeth because I have to see my face staring back at me. Makeup isn't an option at the moment so I just have to suffer with this thing for a bit.

Now the problem:   
I have all the problems I did before with the dining hall, and now I also have to deal with the anxiety of knowing that everyone sees my ugly face and might think I'm trying to trick them by wearing feminine clothing. There's also the possibility floating in the back of my mind that someone's going to wince at the sound of my voice, give me a look of disgust or even call me a slur. It also doesn't help that past body image issues have normalized going without food for me. I haven't been able to make myself go to dinner for the past week. If I had to guess, I've had between 800-1000 calories per day on average for the last 4 days. I know I need to go, but I just haven't been able to.

Sorry for the text wall, but I thought the context was important.  I need advice on how to get through this, anything (non-hateful) is appreciated.",1579930674.0,0.72,4

Exhausting Clinical Session,So today I finally got myself to see my psychologist which I must admit is a really down to earth and cool guy and had a weird experience after talking about some of my current issues which have in a way worsened since my last therapy almost a year ago. I spoke to him about some of my past experiences which include my military service for which I had made my mind was not connected to my anxiety problems. After learning about my experiences about my deployment and how I felt before and after he was very adamant that what I was describing were textbook symptoms of PTSD but I had somehow failed to recognized them as such. Then out of nowhere I felt an uncontrollable urge to cry when I thought about all the pain and suffering that this condition (anxiety or PTSD) has caused me and couldn't control myself to the point where I cried in front of him. I really  became ashamed of myself for doing this but my psychologist was pretty calm and encouraged me to let my emotions run and explained to me the importance of opening up to him. After a while I was able to calm myself down and we continue to talk about some of the underlying issues that could be causing my condition and developed a plan to bring about relief to how I'm feeling. I did feel better after my therapy session ended and have to say that I've made a commitment to follow through with my treatment and hopefully getting better.

Howdy. Anyone else get random pounding heartbeats?,"I have a panic disorder which is a type of anxiety disorder in which I have panic attacks for literally no reason at all. When these occur my heart starts POUNDING in my chest, like I can almost feel it coming through my shirt, and it feels like I am going to die. I really genuinely in the moment feel as though I am dead/dying. I’ve tried many things to get myself to calm down, feet tracing, grounding, breathing, all the shit. Those make me feel like something really is actually wrong since I’m paying attention to it and maybe I really am dying. The only thing that seems to calm it down is completing a “task”. Getting up to get water, take a shower, turn the tv on. It’s the only thing that gets my brain switched off from it, and usually it has to be multiple tasks or one big one to really calm me or at least make me forget I was having the attack. Thinking about previous attacks gives me attacks. I’m a borderline hypochondriac I think because any tiny sensation on or in my body can send me into a I THINK IM DYING panic. I am in hell.

Fear of not answering texts.,"Recently a guy I graduated highschool with added me to fb. We hadn't spoken in years. We did the chitchat, catch up, cute kids, blah blah blah chat once. About a month later he texted me and made a joke, I responded. He responded back, but I never did.  A few days later he killed himself. 
I was working 12 1/2 hours a day for two weeks straight. All I was doing was sleeping and working. I really dont talk to anyone very much while I'm at work. Now that seems like a shitty excuse. I could have texted him back if I had wanted. He was reaching out and I ignored him. Now I cant ignore anyone. Every text I think it's a suicidal friend who might be reaching out. If I dont immediately text back, the anxiety drives me insane until I do. I got a text that said "" it is time"" and immediately went into panic mode thinking it was a suicide thing. It wasn't.

This was coming from the director of my org. and he had to talk her down from moving me completely out of the org. Ever since that I have been dealing with a constant feeling that I was going to be fired at any moment. And then when I moved out of that org. It kicked into high gear when I became a manager in a different org. And had a really bad acting manager above me who seemed to have a problem with me but he called it ""training"". This was about a year ago and almost everyday walking into work I would get the belly ach and the worry feeling. Regardless of the fact I received great reviews from my permanent manager.

I saw a therapist on Wednesday and discussed all of this. She helped me understand the flipside to my worries. And reminding myself everyday I worried and nothing bad has happened yet, so why?. Since then so far so good. I know 2 days but progress. I'll see her again next week.

My Anxiety caused me to go to the ER 6 times.

Now today my leg is swelling and in pain and I think I might be having blood clots. So I called 911 and showed them my skin. They then told me to if I could feel my toes and feet and I said yes.

Need help and guidance fighting my disorder," Hello everyone, 

I would like to share my experience with my anxiety disorder and get some feedback from you guys on how to combat it. Ever since I was young, I felt different than the kids around me, in the sense that I was always anxious about everything for example grades, parents' expectations, and mostly religion whereas they were super cool and didn’t care about anything. Then in high school, I started to develop unexplained physical symptoms. I started to get diarrhea and stomach pain every single day for three straight years. No doctor knew what was wrong with me and I was always being referred to other doctors. This was really difficult and the bus rides in the morning were honestly some of the worst experiences of my life as I used to have an emergency nature call every single time. 

Then Uni started and I no longer had a tight strict morning schedule and somehow my stomach problems all went away. But to my surprise, I started getting this really weird intense sharp pain in my neck that used to get much worse when I lay down to the ground due to the pressure. I went back to the doctor and again, they couldn’t find anything wrong with me. I used to be super anxious about the possibility of having a life-threatening disease. I visited the ER several times especially when the pain  was associated with shortness of breath, dizziness and chest pain. This went on for 3 years until my senior year and it somehow it just gradually went away without it being diagnosed. 

At that point, I stopped any getting physical pains or symptoms and started developing the weirdest phobias. It all started when I noticed that am getting chest pains and lightheadedness whenever I am in a car. This started subconsciously and took me a week or two to notice. I used to drive every day to Uni, I couldn’t anymore due to the horrible panic attacks. I also started to become terribly petrified of flights and couldn’t work out anymore due to breathing issues as I would get a panic attack every time I’m at the gym. The fear of transportation is completely destroying my ability to properly function and its seriously affecting my day to day. Moreover, I’m only 22 years old and half of my hair is already white which I attribute to me freaking and stressing out about everything for the past few years. 

I went back to the doctor and she diagnosed me with severe anxiety. She prescribed me Lexapro 10 mg every day for the next two months. I have read online about the possible side effects especially on the brain and am very worried this might affect my job performance ( I’m in engineering and my job requires a lot of critical thinking). Therefore, what are your experiences with this medication and its effects on your body and brain?  Are there any other affordable alternatives that could work better, as therapy is very expensive around here?  What other things I could do to get rid of my anxiety? Any suggestions would be helpful.  I apologize for my bad English as I am not a native speaker. 

Thank you in advance for your help, I really appreciate it.",1579922821.0,1.0,0

Is overthinking apart of anxiety?,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. Let me get to the point i overthink alot i always have Im always thinking of what if this happens what if i don’t do this what if this and that i know it’s natural everyone overthinks. I overthink to the point where i start to believe the things im making up in my head. Me and my gf had this argument one time and we’ve argued about it so many times because im like what if she’s just lying that way i can believe her and I’ll stop arguing. It’s nothing bad our relationship is good no abuse nothing like that. It’s just i overthink it so many times and i start to believe what im thinking and i feel lile shes lying to me and it makes me upset and stressed and i don’t want to talk to her because of this. It sucks because sometimes i overthink to the point where i won’t go through with something because of me overthinking. Anyways i like to believe her because she says she’s always honest with me we’re in a relationship we should be honest and i believe her i was doing good and from time to time i would overthink the situation but ignore it bc i would tell myself stop just believe her. Just yesterday i started overthinking bad again and it makes me talk about it again but i don’t want to argue because she’s told me so many times yet my mind tells me she’s lying to you. It sucks is this anxiety? I get anxious alot too",1579922118.0,1.0,5
I went to therapy today!,So today I started therapy for my anxiety. It feels really good that I went. I Woke up this morning feeling really good and I wasn’t anxious at all and I went there and I met the nice therapist lady and I just kind of told her my history and it was nice to talk to someone and just let everything out. I want to encourage everyone to try and see someone if they can I know it might be too expensive for some but for those that can please do. My insurance covered this lady all I have to do is pay 25 a session and I think it’s going to help me. I’ve been feeling good these last couple of weeks but only because I went into hermit crab mode and have isolated myself from the outside world. I know it’s not the healthiest method but it feels like a hard restart on life sometimes you need to bunker down and get your life straightened out before you can face the world. I know all of this is just words but I hope everyone is doing alright out there. Don’t give up hope.,1579921915.0,0.81,0

DENTAL WORK TOTALLY HAS ME FUCKED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY,"So I’m 35 with what I thought was perfect teeth! Haha, noooo! I go to the dentist bc a tooth broke and at the same time was having insane pain from a back molar that had never had an issue. Ends up I needed a root canal.... that ended up in 3 root canals at once, broken lost tooth due to shitty root canal that now needs a dental implant. A 4 thousand dollar bill I just paid in cash to avoid interest fees for the two successful root canals and for him destroying my healthy tooth, entirely! 

Then back to my dentist, beautiful and intimidating lady who is insanely talented. She is 1 of 79 in the whole United States in a special American dental association for all the nice ass teeth work she has done to a perfect 10 over 80 cases of full mouth reconstructions. So she’s damn good and I get the fortunate chance to realize through her mannerisms that she knows she’s good and did I say .... DAMN GOOD! She’s cocky. Long story short she gives me and my husband a bill for 37,500 apparently all the work I had done on my teeth which is over 50 thousand through the years did not pay off! In fact I have decay under all my crowns and it all needs redone! My stomach dropped and I’m still extremely sick over it, but not over the money although that part sucks too! Mostly over the crazy 8 hour sessions of fkn mind altering drilling, stretching my mouth open, smelling burning flesh from all the heat used to put on crowns and the anticipation to bite down normally like a normal person. You can’t though bc all your teeth have been shaved down to prep for crowns...... the whole time you are literally stuck in a dentist chair who you’ve obligated their time and their entire staff and whole schedule that day to doing all your bottom teeth! Next appointment it’ll be your top teeth, who in the fk wants to go back?  Well that will be me obligated bc my husband doesn’t want a toothless wife ..... that is the only other option. People of you have anorexia or bulimia STOP 🛑 unless you have a small fortune and want to feel like your in the movie “hostile” I mean I’m freaking out! I’ve tried tons extra of nerve pills, procrastinating, telling myself my teeth look fine so they must be okay, that my dentist is evil 😈 and just wants all my money. The harsh reality is I’m just scared for my life. I have a option to be put to sleep..... or heavily medicated. I’m not sure which one. Last time they tried putting me to sleep in a OR I kinked the line of proprofal and pulled the gas mask off it was for a endoscopy! I had done this 4 other times. How do you Medicare someone like me? How am I going to get over this? I have to go to the dentist Monday for some emergency bonding bc I messed up a bottom veneer and lost it.... I think a mouse ran off with my veneer!

Stress Relief Tips?,"I'm really going through it right now. 

Two quizzes this week and both caused a panic attack. One was so bad that my hands were shaking almost to the point where I couldn't answer questions. I fought back tears while I walked to my next lecture and had to ask my sister, who had been waiting for me, to not wait for me because I knew the moment she asked how I was or hugged me, I would burst into tears. 

I've been working ahead for all of my classes to the point where I don't technically have to do any work until next week. Even then, I still think that I need to be productive and that I need to get stuff done even though I have no idea why I'm working so far ahead.

I've been without my personal laptop for over a month and when I got it back, I realized there's a dent on the bottom (don't know if it was caused by me or the repair center) and it wouldn't charge until a little while ago. If I want the dent fixed, I have to have a repairman come to my dorm because I don't have break until March. That involves talking to someone on the phone, scheduling something, and waiting around with some strange person until it's fixed. So basically, my own personal hell.

I can't really describe how stressed I am beyond feeling like I'm bursting with stress. My G.A.D. has been insane this week. I'm only just now having my second meal of the day at 8 pm because I'm so overwhelmed.

How do you cope with this madness,"ey guys,

New to this reddit stuff but desperate looking for some answers and advice! Long story short, always had anxitey since I came out of the womb, seriously. I know it all to well. HOWEVER, in the last 5 or 6 years now it's gotten to the point where alot in my life is suffering. Family, relationships, work, whole world got shifted and turned upside down. Most days I feel like I'm on a constant rollercoaster and the butterflies get to be so much I feel like I'm going to internally combust. Few years ago I put myself out there and met someone and moved away from the only support system. The relationship went beyond toxic and my partner wasn't amazing and made me isolate myself from everybody I knew and my family. Ended up getting to the point where I kicked her out but left me in a state that has completley abd utterly defeated me. I'm stuck in a city now where I do not know anybody, I manage to keep a job but Its not a social job and everybody is double my age. I never leave the house, it's even gotten to the point where I go get groceries and my hands drip with sweat. My whole body is drenched by the time I leave. I cant even talk properly with out mumbling like a moron. Anyways, I've always like my space and my alone time but sometimes these panic attacks just hit me and I ask myself wtf am I doing. I'm 30 and alone, I have no family left, no friends, I'm dying to be with someone but everytime I attempt I shut down. Last few months just keep creeping up on me and I feel like I'm crawling out of my skin. Watching people walk by, drive by, walking dog and here I am, looking out my window watching life just go bye bye. How do you cope with days like this. For those who will ask, I am on ciperlex and have been for over a year now, it helps but I feel I need readjusting on my dosage. I just, I feel trapped, and you go on social media and good god... 

I just need to know if someone else goes through this madness, how do you cope?? How do you keep going on?

"Fuck You, parents. That is all (TRIGGER WARNING. child abuse/sexual assault. No details)","I've had anxiety since i was a child, i just didn't know that's what it was then. It seems like it has intensified over the years, more so 10 years ago when I became a momma. I've always had fears, i was born into a cult, physically, mentally, and emotionally abused, as well as sexually assaulted. Not only did i suffer at the hands of the church, but was raised around predators and pedophiles, literally throughout my ENTIRE childhold. My mind has known nothing but torment. I left the church at 24, I'm 30 now, and within the last month cut communication with my family. While my parents are no longer apart of the church, my mother, still believes that they aren't terrible people, just flawed. It's been a huge trigger for me, opening up, and sharing my pains with her, just to have it minimised and justified. This week i sell and pack up the rest of my shit to move 1000 miles away with my babies and husband to start fresh. I know it doesn't fix my problem but it gives me a new beginning, where they don't know where i am. I have deleted all my social media accounts and plan on changing my number as well. 
I guess my vent comes in, how the fuck do you allow so much abuse to happen to your child, as well as participate in it, and then have the fucking nerve to down play my mental illnesses, telling me my diagnosises are man made to keep me oppressed, and medicated.

i ask myself, do i want to die? and the answer is no, i don't really want to... but i just feel so tired of everything, tired of being my own prison. and today sent me right back to that place. i entered my apartment after being mugged and looked out my window and though ""maybe i should just jump down"". i wanted to cry. i could feel the desperation, the sadness and the helplessness down my skin... but as usual, no emotions ""came outside"", the only thing that comes out is anxiety and fear.

Chronic tickle/need to dry cough for 8 years - doctors tell me it's mental,"Hello,

&#x200B;

23 M.

just wanted to ask whether someone has the same symptoms as me. I had a common cold 8 years ago in Winter (fever, cough, runny nose...) and since then, from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep I feel that uncomfortable tickle/irritation making you cough. Coughing doesn't make it go away, it's there 24/7 for the past 8 years. I've visited EVERY possible doctor and had many uncomfortable tests, nothing was proven positive. I keep getting told it's psychosomatic and I should take anti-depressants because there is just no proven cause.

&#x200B;

Now of course I still can't believe it. Maybe if it wasn't for the cold back then I could get behind the idea that it's mental... but it just doesn't seem like something you can ""think up"" and I just don't know why anxiety would present itself like this. I admit I'm a VERY anxious person, but that's mainly because of this problem. I used to be happy, last years have been nothing but miserable due to this problem.

"Sudden anxiety, especially while driving.","I moved across the country about seven months ago, and since then I've been a way less confident driver and it gets worse every time i drive. Starting about two months ago it has gotten to a point where it's starting to impact my life. I now walk to work every day. Doesnt matter if it's cold or raining really hard, I walk there and back every day. Luckily it's only about two miles. 

The biggest problem, though, is when I have to drive my wife to work on my two days off each week. She works 30 minutes away and I have to drive through the city (the most anxious part of the drive). I get super paranoid and have thoughts like, 

""what if I don't see a pedestrian?"" 
""what if I accidentally run a red light?"" 
""Did I just run that stop sign?"" 
Etc.

I don't know where this anxiety comes from, I used to be a very confident driver. I've never gotten in an accident while driving, I'm never in a hurry or speeding, I've never even gotten so much as a parking ticket. I'm just so scared to drive all the time, and I have to go pick my wife up in an hour and I'm dreading it.

Thanks to anyone who reads this. None of my friends really understand when I tell them, and I just wanted to share my feelings with some people who have probably gone through this. Any advice is welcome.",1579907078.0,1.0,1

Anxiety?,3 days ago I woke up from a dead sleep due to a heart arrhythmia at 5am. I'm not sure what the arrhythmia was but it consisted of 1 hard beat followed by 4 fast ones. That lasted about 6 hours. I have a history of heart problems most notably Brugada syndrome also I have an ICD (implanted defibrillator ). I tried calling my cardiologist 4 times and left a message each time but got no return call. I'm able to upload the info my ICD records to the cardiologist office which I did and had a nurse look over what it picked up. Unfortunately it only seems to record episodes where my heart rate goes up to 150bpm which it did 5 times that day but they told me it's nothing to be worried about. I was able to get a hold of an on call cardiologist that prescribed me quinidine which got me out of that terrible arrhythmia. My main concern is I only feel safe in bed and if I get up to go to the bathroom or anything my heart rate will spike to about 110bpm for about 10-15 seconds. It just doesn't take much to set it off to a fast heart rate and it's been like this for 3 days. I feel like I can't get any help from doctors as they barely return my calls. Is this a sign of anxiety or something else?,1579904740.0,1.0,0

My worst fear kinda helps me cope with my other fears,"Halloween is a time where spooky things become the norm around the western world, and haunted houses are an activity where people pay to enter a space where they will be intentionally scared. 

When i look back on my *worst* anxious moments in life I see mostly times where I did not enter a haunted house. 
There was even a cave in a arcade called ""haunted pirate cave"" the sign said ""7 years old and up"" and the tunnel in the cave was small enough to fit a toddler comfortably. It fit 17 year old me very uncomfortably.
My parents joked that it was one skeleton diorama around the first bend but I was physically opposed to that experience at all, I was covered in cold sweat and my fun meter had hit rock bottom. I chickened out, I had hit my hard limit there buddy. 

There was a professional kids haunted house at my local big amusement park, it had a big budget but mild scares yet i still couldn't do it. Every flat surface from the ground to the celling was covered in themed and threatening props. It's disorienting to take in a scene where the more you look the more spike covered beds, iron maidens, spooky masks and blood puddles there were. I chickened out very quickly. 

Today I went to an interview for a job and I was covered in cold sweats again. What helped get me in the door was thinking ""this isn't like a haunted house, you're just there to answer some questions."" 
I'm probably more scared of social events than haunted houses, since social events usually happen more often than haunted houses. However in the moment, I know that no matter what situation i'm in I will not be as physically immovable as when I am in front of a haunted house. 

With anxiety everything becomes harder, and those thoughts like ""it could be worse"" don't help, but I kinda neglected how mundane my most pressing anxieties are. 

Maybe one day I will finish a haunted house, my eyes will be closed the whole time and i will be clinging for dear life to the convoy of bodyguards I hired to protect me, but I imagine that the realization upon seeing daylight again could give me perspective of my anxiety in general. 

The thought of ordering food, or inviting a friend over for dinner makes me want to crawl into a cave and live there forever, but it kinda helped me put things into perspective that i'd crawl into any cave except The Haunted Pirate Cave.",1579903996.0,1.0,0
My anxiety affecting others?,"How do you deal with the negative effect your anxiety can have on others?

Some examples:

An ex-girlfriend started experiencing anxiety & panic while she was going out with me. After & before me, she didn't have anxiety symptoms.

Others have commented that I scare them, or I'm just plain weird.

So the question:

I know that laughter is contagious, and I feel that anxiety can also rub off on others.

I know that feeling a panic attack can be terrifying, and I wouldn't want to inflict my troubles on anyone.

How do I deal with this?

I have already given up on dating, but I have to keep working, so there will always be coworkers and family who I can affect.

Whenever someone close to me starts showing anxiety symptoms, I feel that I could have contributed to it and I feel guilty.

How do you keep going when it feels like the world is literally ending?,"The planet is dying. I'm in the us and the state of the economy in the us means owning a home or retiring are not likely. I'm trying to get a job in my field, but the jobs in my field are barely paying more than minimum wage and employers don't generally offer benefits. Healthcare is so expensive I haven't been to a doctor in years. Everything in the world is just so fucked up, and as an individual it feels like I have no power.

On a personal level, I'm stuck at a minimum wage job that just cut my hours in half - before I was breaking even, now I'm taking money out of savings to make rent. I could get a job that pays better, but my current job gives me a the flexibility to apply to jobs, go to interviews, and work on personal projects that may help me get a job in my field, so it feels worth it to stay even though I hate it. My field is design - don't worry, I know I made a mistake. I feel so fucking stupid, thinking I could make a living doing something I'm good at. I need new references but I don't know how to go about getting new ones. I know what I need to do to improve my life, but there's just so many things to do that it's overwhelming. If I try to take a step towards bettering myself I get swamped in anxiety and can't continue, and then it makes it even harder to keep trying the next day knowing how much fucking time I've wasted by being so anxious.

It feels like my only options are to keep my head down and power through it even though it feels like making a life for myself is an impossible goal. How do you convince yourself to keep going when it feels like in a few years the world might end and the work will have been for nothing?

I know that I've managed to get my shit together in a lot of ways. I don't eat out, I cook all my meals and eat really healthy. I keep a really tight budget, my sleep schedule is great and I keep to it. I just can't make enough money to fucking live! I can't afford to be alive! And it just feels like even if I did land my dream job it would have a shitty work life balance, or it still wouldn't pay enough for me to break even, or that the economy will continue to be total shit while the people at the top squeeze out whatever they can and wages stagnate. It's just so frustrating to try knowing how bad things actually are. I try to stay positive - I'm healthy, as far as I know, I live somewhere with a relatively low cost of living, I have a home, the heat and electricity and water are on. I don't have that much debt and I'm in a much better position than a lot of people. It just feels so hopeless anyway.

Really losing the will to live! / Health Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

New to this posting malarkey, but I really am at my wits end, so thought I'd just write and see if anybody could help me out. Gonna be a bit of a long one, so bare with me! -

I've suffered from anxiety since I was about 16, (I'm 22 now), but it has only gotten unmanageable in the last couple of months. It started when I went on holiday and had a panic attack walking around the city centre, very fast pulse, sweating, dizziness.. etc. Since that day, I have had an obsession with checking my pulse, checking my breathing and googling my symptoms! It first started with obsessing over having a heart attack, then a blood clot, then a pulmonary embolism. It feels like just one thing after another. And when I get over one thing, my brain will start obsessing over another. I have been to the doctors and A&E more times than I can count over the couple of months, and everything has been fine - putting it down to anxiety.

I really do just feel like I can't take it anymore. I can't watch TV, I can't sleep, I can't eat. I am constantly just worrying and checking my health. I just worry myself that they haven't checked my health with X-Rays and scans. They have checked my pulse, oxygen levels, blood pressure, blood, done an ECG. I am overweight at the moment, but not to a point that it's *dangerous*. This sounds so stupid writing this - I wan't to lose weight, but I am scared that I will have a heart attack and die. How pathetic is that? I can see how stupid it is as I'm writing the words down, but in the moment I cannot think of anything else other than certain death.

I have constant air hunger. Feeling like I can't take a full breath, or like I need to yawn but cannot. I have experienced this before when I was new to anxiety, but it came and went. Maybe half an hour or so at a time, and then I'd just forget about it. But for the last two weeks or so, it's been everyday. Constant. If I manage to take my mind off things, go out with friends or my partner, it will go for awhile. But the SECOND I have a second alone to myself to think, it starts again. I think I've just made myself worse by googling symptoms, but I've obviously (me being me) put this down to shortness of breath and a pending heart attack or pulmonary embolism.

I have a telephone appointment next week to help sort some sort of therapy for me, but I was just wondering if anyone has any tips for the mean time (whether it's a tip for my breathing, for anxiety or depression, I'm all ears!) - or if anybody could actually just ease my mind and let me know I'm not actually going to die, and what I'm experiencing is very normal. (Plz lol) I just feel bad going back to the GP again, knowing full well that I actually am okay and I could be taking up somebody's appointment that genuinely needs it. Should probably mention I am on fluoxetine for depression (40mg) and propranolol for anxiety. (40mg)

I really just HATE myself at the moment. I can't see any light past this. It's gotten to a point where I have had to quit university because I have not been keeping up with any work, I haven't been able to CONCENTRATE on any work for a start. It's taking over my life. I wake up every day thinking I am dying. I am losing touch of relationships with my friends, my boyfriend, my family - all because of something I can't control. Just wish I wasn't like this.

Can’t Stop Shaking Profusely (20F),"I had what I believe to be a panic attack earlier today and went to the ER.

I have not stopped shaking. Every part of me is shaking. This happens to me semi often, especially at night, but it usually goes away after half an hour. This is by far the worst shaking I’ve had.

I ruined my last two terms of school,"I'm probably overreacting, but honestly I just can't calm myself down. I'm not even sure if I should post this here, but here we go.

So, we're frequently doing tasks in groups at chemistry class. With the end of the first term, the teacher yesterday wanted to rearrange the groups for the last two terms. He choosed me as one of the groupleaders and this already triggered my anxiety, because me in a leadership position sounds terrifying. My eyes were already teared up, and my classmate's expecting look didn't help either. Some of them even hid behind the others when it was my turn to choose, so I can't see them and then probably won't choose them. The teacher rushed me to choose and I panicked and random names bursted out of my mouth. And with this I made the worst group of all four. I chosen groupmates that are not even good at chemistry and when I saw their faces, I wanted to kill myself right there and then. They looked like they go to their own demise or something. Two of my groupmates already argued in the first ten minutes, but I was too afraid and anxious to do something and the teacher rebuked them, while all the other groups were silent and working peacefully. I feel so horrible when I think about the remaining chemistry classes, I just don't know how to deal with it or just to calm down.

I know this sounds like a ridiculous or minor thing, but I can't stop replaying the whole situation and I can't stop tearing up and eventually crying, because of how am I such a failure that can't even select a few groupmembers.",1579898978.0,1.0,5
A little information about the „deadly“ corona virus,"I know some of you got REALLY anxious (including me) regarding the news about the corona virus in China. So to help I thought I put a list of facts together about the virus:

1. 26 People died of this virus as of writing this, of course this is a lot, but if you look into it many if not all of them were ill beforehand, tumors, diabetes, cancer and the sorts. 

2. it is believed that this virus is not only LESS deathly then the SARS virus in the 2000‘s which killed over 800 people but less infectious also. 

3. this is not a fact or anything but the media want clicks, and there’s no better way to bring people to click on your article with a news that is for everyone, and „deadly“. 

So yeah it’s a common cold but on drugs, so unless you’re deathly sick now and living in China you shouldn’t have to worry to much.

What is your mindset towards anxiety?,"On good days, I believe that I can learn to manage my anxiety so that I don’t feel overwhelmed by it everyday. 

I used to think I could “fix” it and get back to “normal”. I don’t think this is possible anymore. I think that since I have anxiety it’s something that I have to deal with for the rest of my life, there’s no escaping it, but there’s managing it. 

This mindset in itself can get me down sometimes. I wish with all my heart that I could make anxiety disappear and it depresses me when I think about having to deal with it for the rest of my life. 

I do have good months where I experience very little anxiety and feel relatively normal, but I haven’t had that for 2 years now.

I've always struggled with anxiety in college. I was doing so well and then I took a big step back and I feel terrible.,"TLDR: I've always struggled with anxiety and falling behind in college. I was doing so well this semester and then I took a big step back and I feel terrible.

I have been struggling with my anxiety since about 4th grade (it is mainly test/classes related, but sometimes not). I've gone to many therapists since then, but none of them really helped long term. I've always felt that my anxiety comes in waves and sometimes brings along a depression. I'm a computer science major, so school takes a lot of hard work.

Each semester it starts off well, I have a good sleep schedule, go to classes, eat 3 meals, etc. But then something always happens and I get out of a good pattern and into a negative one. I will stay up late one night, then skip breakfast the next day because I wasn't up. Then I'll feel really guilty for not getting up early (8-9am). If I missed class, I just get this horrible anxious and nervous feeling(It will usually be around 12pm now). I feel very hopeless in that moment and only feel comforted by the softness of my bed. Sometimes I stay there until late afternoon(3-4pm), just not able to get up and face my classes, homework, or tests(especially if it is a test day I have lots of difficulty getting up). 

Then, it turns into a vicious cycle. I can't fall asleep until 2-4am because I am very anxious about everything I missed in class/feel guilty about missing class and falling behind. Then be because I went to bed so late again, I cannot wake up in the morning and the cycle repeats. It eventually becomes so much (all the missed work and missed classes to make up) that I stop showering for a few days and just neglect my self-care.

I had this almost every single semester, but it was at it's worst last semester (I had so much going on. I took about 23 credits, got into my first long-term relationship, etc.). Despite all of this I am still a pretty good student (I only got As and Bs, until last semester, but that also really brought me down). I actually am quite an accomplished person for struggling with anxiety (I have a covered on campus job that pays well, I started the Engineering Club at my college and it is succeeding, I did high-level quantum mechanics research as a junior, I got a competitive CS internship, then scored a full-time position from a job fair in about 20 minutes as a junior and finally converted the internship into a job offer, that I accepted)! (Note: Listing all these accomplishments, helps me feel better, and that I actually do have most of my future and life together, even though the day to day can be hard!) I do end up making everything up slowly, eventually during the reading week after classes have stopped. I usually tell my professors as soon as it becomes a problem and they have been very kind and understanding with me. They let me make things up late or meet with me, etc.

Fast forward to this semester, spring semester of senior year. I just got back from a super relaxing trip in Europe and I was doing well there. Eating 3 meals, sleep at 11pm, waking up at 8-9am, very relaxed and calm. When I got back I was continuing this great pattern. I was so happy and on a high. Then my friends were hanging out last night and it was 10:00pm, then 11:00pm. Next thing I know it's 11:30pm and I think I should go to my room and sleep. Everyone was just having such a good time, so I stayed and I ended up staying until 1am. I enjoyed it too! 

(Note, we don't have class on Friday, so that isn't a problem here.) I have 3 CS assignments due on Monday. Almost finished one of them, but was struggling with fixing some bugs and my compiler (thing used to run the program) wasn't working. I asked a friend to help me fix it earlier that day and she couldn't really help me. Maybe I just felt defeated like I couldn't even check my code, so why bother trying to figure out. I also have fun events all day Sunday, so that made me anxious as well (like not having that time for homework). Not sure exactly why I did this, but I decided to watch an episode of a show on Netflix. We all know that is a rabbit hole... So here I am the next morning after watching 8 episodes at 8:30am, feeling sad and guilty. (I stopped watching TV last semester because it was a huge distraction and I generally think it is a waste of time, but it does help me relax. I only watched a movie over the break.) I was really hoping to get up early and work on my CS homework. Instead, I fell asleep and woke up at 1pm. 

I just feel so terrible. I'm really stressed and worried that I won't complete the assignments on time. But more that this is the start of repeating the same downward spiral as every previous semester. I really don't want to go back there again. It is a really dark and depressive place. I asked my mom to see a therapist, because I wanted to prevent this. We got names and phone numbers of therapists on my insurance in the area. I just haven't called any yet. I'm anxious and nervous that this will set me back before I can reach out for help.

I know that I am starting to feel overwhelmed, like I cannot complete my work on time. My brain is fuzzy and hurts from lack of sleep and I don't know what to do? I feel like I need immediate support as I can't see a therapist yet. Maybe I'm just being too hard on myself, but I still feel all this pressure to do well as a computer science major in my last semester. Any kind words of advice?

Update: While editing this I also came across more anxious thoughts. I feel so incompetent when I have a lot of anxiety and I cannot go to class. I dream of being a role model and leader in STEM. But how can people possibly look up to me when I cannot even go to my own classes/get my work done on time.

I am in a wonderful, supportive, healthy and loving relationship. He is absolutely terrific, knows about my anxiety and is incredibly supportive. I know he is going to propose soon, I don't know when. That's not the point of anxiety though. Even though, I love him so much and my rational brain has made the decision to marry him. I just still worry with my anxious brain that I'm not marrying the right person and that I don't love him enough. I feel anxious like I could be making a mistake. I feel like I always have to think of fond memories of him and our times together to remind me that I really do love him and want to marry him. A lot of times, I just push away my feelings of love for him because they are so strong. So maybe that's why I sometimes need to think about it again. When I let myself feel them it is very intense and I usually end up crying tears of happiness. 

I just sent him everything before the update part and he sent back a very supportive text saying that he thinks I can get back into a good rhythm and that I don't have to do dinner with his family or friends next week if it is too much for me. He is really so great!!",1579898364.0,1.0,4

It’s not that I don’t want to get diagnosed; I do, in fact it would be such a relief to have a genuine reason for why I’m like this. It’s the actual process of going to a doctor that terrifies me, and even more than that, the fear that I’m making it up and I don’t really have anxiety at all. I don’t know what I’d do if I was told I didn’t have it. It’s stupid but I’d feel like a failure almost... for half my life I’ve justified my fears with the idea of having some undiagnosed anxiety, but if it’s not true and I’m just a normal person who gets nervous then I don’t know what I’ll do with myself. Basically, I desperately want to have a diagnosis, but if I’m told I don’t have anxiety, I’ll be devastated and so embarrassed for wasting my doctor’s time too.

I suppose I’m just wondering if anyone else felt like this, or if anyone has any advice. I know it sounds really dumb haha. Thanks for reading.",1579896891.0,0.89,13

"Advice for a panic attack ""hangover""?","Hey everyone!

So this week has been pretty stressful. For the past 3-4 days, I have not been able to sleep much due to intense bouts of stress due to various things. Two nights ago I had a huge panic attack at night that left me sore all over and completely exhausted yesterday. Last night was the first night I was able to get a good night's sleep- and I slept well! Lol. However, this morning I woke up lightheaded, weak and barely able to open my eyes. I guess this is what a hangover feels like! My body is finally telling me how exhausted it is. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to care for myself today? I love to swim, and was thinking about going for a swim but my body might be too tired for that today. Maybe I could go out to eat with a friend or something like that? I was also thinking I could go to the counseling center at my school and get signed up for some talk therapy appointments. Lol usually I would exercise but I dont wanna overdo it!",1579895893.0,1.0,0
Strong anxiety around what people think of me,"This applies mainly to friends or acquaintances who I want to become closer with.

Will they now dislike me or think less of me?

It's exhausting having this constant stream of consciousness going through my head. I just want to relax and not worry so much about what others are thinking. Please help! What is this and what can I do about it?",1579895851.0,1.0,3

Vibrating symptom?,"Hi all! Quick symptom question. 

Does anyone else get an anxiety symptom where, when you lay down in bed, your body starts “vibrating” or feeling like you’re having heart palpitations in your entire body?

Doctors have told me it’s my anxiety manifesting itself (and I AM under a lot of stress, so I believe it’s certainly plausible) but I can’t shake this feeling it’s coming from something else. 

I wanted to see if anyone else experiences this. Might help put my mind at ease. I already take pretty good care of myself: healthy diet, adequate water consumption, yoga and meditation about 3-4 days a week, don’t have caffeine...

Tincture (indica, if possible or desired)

Please answer? What should I do? Just ignore it? I have a bully in the house ?,"I’m twenty. Ever since I finished high school first year I was studying administration. I wanted to just work and figure out what to do with life. But never got a job so my mother signed my up for a course in office admin. At the time the time the doc let me off my anti depressant. See how it would go. (I grew up with An anxiety disorder. I don’t want to name it specifically. One where a child is capable of speech but can not speak to certain people outside comfort levels). Worst came to worst I started going I don’t know what to do with my life and became depressed. Withdrawed from the course I wasn’t enjoying. Worst came to worst my own 16 year old brother was calling me dumb, idiotic with no future. And constantly.. And frankly I actually wanted to commit suicide.it was all I thought of But never had the guts to actually hurt myself.  Long story. Ended up being put  on the tablet I’ve been forced to take all my teen years.   Currently studying Makeup artistry at Tafe (the Aus community college. It’s more like a grade B uni that anyone can get into for short courses. Nothing wow about it.).  And yeah I’ve still never had a job because it’s hard. I had one job at one point. All I did was serve food at a cafe. lasted less than two weeks because of how nervous I was and terrible customer service. 
My bro (now 17) who thinks he’s the Einstein in the house or something. 
Not long ago when I was at the dinner table with just him he said to me ""You can't even get into University. You're dumb. And You have no future. doing a crap course at cafe, and you can't even get a job. no one will give you a job."" and more and more repeating ""you have no future”
Honestly what does YOU HAVE NO FUTURE even mean. because thats all my lil bro says to me constantly. He even said ""Auntie Jodie actually said that about you today. that no ones going to give you a job. Sleeping all day"" etc. Dam Auntie Jodie.  But really I have a big supportive family. No one pressures me into anything. So far the only person worried and thinks Uni is everything is the bro.  The kid cares about his education, and thinks he’s going to become so successful. Some CEO or something.   Back in HS I did want to go to Uni, yet Auntie Jodie started to be all ""UNI is not everything. there are other ways"" because she doesn't think its for me. Then I agreed. I couldn't even handle senior years (lets call it the finals). All my life I've never been academically bright. I suck at Math, Science and anything to do with numbers.  I don’t know why my brain is wired this way (apparently I get it from my dad) but I just suck at academics!   I dropped Math and all that and did Drama, and Music, and art. I like reading novels. Ive always had this bizarre dream of wanting to become a star .. In acting and singing. And I stilll do. I've taken ton of singing lessons and I was known for singing on the stage at school. Anyway. Yeah. Now here I am. twenty and still unemployed and studying makeup, with dreams I dont know if ill ever Chase to reality.  Currently on holidays and just sleeping all day.
Im trying not to let it get to me. but I think it is ... my own smart ass little brother constantly calling me 'dumb' and saying you have no
future over and over again.  His hobbies include locking himself In his room and playing games of watching documentaries on his tablet all day, and carrying it around the house.    
With the things my brother says to me  ... I try to ignore it, but its actually starts to hurt because I want to cry.  But I won’t because that would be letting it get to me. 
I at least have plans to look for a Job in high end retail makeup after my course (work on my terrible people skills while im at it). Then work and study something musicy.

DAE go through these two things?,"1. Do you guys dream about having loose teeth/teeth falling out/etc? I've had odd dreams involving this many times in the past. Always leaves me feeling tired and cringy after waking up. 

2. Do you have problems talking to people of the opposite gender? (whether it's your family, coworkers, strangers, DRs). Ex: I'm female. It's extremely hard for me to hold small talk or even answer a simple question from male coworkers, family, and strangers. I can't even speak to my dad without feeling super stressed out. I have no history of sexual assault, harrassment, etc. It's just very difficult to communicate to these people. I don't know the root of it.

"Why am I so secretive about my personal life, even mundane details?","This applies moreso to family members than friends and co-workers.  I feel weird about it, and I think it's some sort of defense mechanism to avoid being the center of attention or topic of conversation.

Examples:

\- Started a new job a year ago, and it was a huge pay raise and step up. I only told my parents, and that was because I pretty much had to.

\- Went back to college a few years ago, while working a full time job. Only told a couple of friends and co-workers. Never told a single family member.

\- Thinking of, after 20 years of adulthood, learning to drive and buying a car. Don't really want to discuss with anyone. Considering parking down the street from my house just so my upstairs neighbor (who is a relative) won't see it and ask me questions about the whole deal.

\- I get immensely annoyed by living in the same house as the upstairs relative, because of stupid things that come up as a result - where relatives ""hear"" things from her that are inconsequential, but still annoying to me that they've been discussed.

*""So you like hard cider? I heard there's always a few cans in the recycling bin...""*

*""She told me you're never home on the weekends.""*

*""Heard you buy stuff on Amazon a lot.""*

I mean, these really aren't sensitive secrets - but it still bothers me.

Help. (GAD),"I just wanted to share this, feel free to send back kind words, opinions, or hate.  
But to be honest, what I'd hope for the most, would be some help as an advice on what should I do in the upcoming days/weeks.  
I got my first panic attack out of the blue a couple of days ago.   
Before that, everything was fine and nothing scared me.   
Now it's constant terror, daily panic attacks so strong that I can't feel my legs or breathe. After 2 days off work, having super strong panic attacks and hoping that it'll pass. I found help in a great (and fucking expensive...) private psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with GAD, now I'm booked for psychotherapy and I'm prescribed Lorazepam (which works like a charm and calms me down and helps focus), and an SSRI (that will probably kick in in a month or so).   
Right now I'm on a leave, I stayed home (I am alone), and I will get back to work on Monday.   
I'm a well-earning IT salesman, and I don't know how will my life look from now on, I'm just so afraid that I won't get back to normal. I wish I had an attack once a week and that's it.   
But I feel like I'm now living in a constant attack that only benzo is stoping for a while.  


I'm not afraid of death or an actual health condition. But I'm strongly afraid of those panic attacks and somatic symptoms because they affect life.   
In short: I'm terrified that being afraid of a panic attack will cause a panic attack. And every stressful situation (a business negotiation for example) that I usually could cope with, will cause me to have an attack. 

I'm also terrified of the fact that it's so sudden. My whole life was based around the fact that I was never afraid of anything, now I'm afraid to pick up a calling phone, I don't even understand why, as it's not who I am.   


I keep feeling like I am in a dream since those 3/4 days, everything is so surreal and different.   


As mentioned, Lorazepam (half or 1mg) is helping, and I've taken it three times already since getting back from the psychiatrist on Wednesday, and I'm kind of afraid of it, because I know of possible consequences, but I think it's the only way to survive until SSRI will kick in (I TRY not to worry about what if it won't work on me at all...) as for now they are not doing shit. So that is one of my main concerns, but I guess I will be taking it as long as they are the only thing not making me go into constant convulsions and anorexia.   


Also I'm getting this constant stingy feeling (maybe even pain, but not strong) on the left side of the chest, and I just don't know if it's somatic or no, but it's my main trigger. Benzo makes it lighter, or at least focusing on it doesn't make me go mad on benzo. Today I literally woke up gently (went to sleep while still feeling effects of lorazepam) with that stinging in my chest, after 2 minutes I started thinking about it and focusing on it, and that led me to a full-blown panic attack, that only benzo stopped.   


Afraid of that Monday, and going back to work, I want to, I just want to be sure that I'm in good shape. Currently, everything is so foggy, it's like being constantly in the state that you are in the morning before you fully open your eyes and drink a sip of water.

Dealing with Existential Angst,"By all accounts I have an incredibly fortunate and privileged life. I'm in great health, pretty intelligent, have a stable, well-paying job in the tech sector, a beautiful partner, my friends and colleagues consider me to be kind, etc. etc. 

However, I've always had a nagging anxiety in the back of my mind. I can never work hard enough, exercise enough, eat well enough. My mindset has always been that of achievement. ""You need to achieve \_\_\_\_\_. You'll be happy when \_\_\_\_\_"". 

The past 2 years in particular have culminated in this anxiety taking over my day-to-day life. I wake up with a pit in my stomach every day and that feeling never quite goes away. Meditation and exercise help, but my responsibilities, be they self-imposed or not, seem to always leave me with this feeling that I'm on a never ending treadmill of to do's. I feel purposeless and aimless.

Part of me feels like I lack passion. I look back to earlier times in my life where I've had that *thing* in my life that I could rely on to elevate my mood. Typically, these were physical activities (martial arts, gymnastics, etc.). I don't have that anymore and I've been paralyzed trying to find the next one. I honestly don't know if it will help or will it serve to mask the issues that I'm facing now.

I feel invincible some days and others I struggle to have a positive thought.

"My worst fear since being diagnosed with GAD, is having a fatal heart attack.","Since being diagnosed with anxiety in June, it's been a long road. I'm a fairly healthy guy.

I get a lot of anxiety about how much of the book is still left and how much I don't know yet. I enjoy learning a lot, but these thoughts destroy my happiness when am doing things I love. This is the main reason why I don't read so much. Right now am taking an online class and I enjoy it so much that I sometimes squeal with joy when I have those ""Aha"" moments. But the racing thoughts again - ""OMG, there are so many more lectures left! So I still don't know all of this stuff. I wish I did not have this much left. Dammit, why is this lecture so long?! God, I can't remember what I studied in school when they discussed this topic. "" And it keeps going on and on. These thoughts destroy my joy of learning and I need advice on managing them.

Heart or anxiety?,"First of all, I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Grew up in a stressful household & my parents allowed things to happen to me that are affecting my health today.

I get into spurts where I get super anxiety over something usually health related and if I don't control it within 24 hours I instantly go into a deep depression. 

Last Tuesday I was at work and it was a particularly stressful day plus alot on my mind. I randomly had a panic attack and it caused my heart rate to spike. I calmed down but my heart rate stayed up. By Sunday I was such a worried mess that I went to the ER where they ran tests and told me my heart is good , it's just anxiety. I have not been able to eat or shower. I've bathed once in this time. 

This week on Tuesday I had a panic attack at work & they called 911 because my heart wouldn't calm down. Once again, got to the hospital and they said my heart is good. I'm still dealing with the elevated heart rate or so I think. When I'm sitting or laying down I feel like it's normal. As soon as I sit up it feels like it's racing/pounding. I can sleep just fine in fact I've been sleeping pretty well. Soon as I open my eyes my heart rate is up. I feel so run down, I've been picking eating at healthy things but not alot. Maybe 50 calories a day no kidding. ALOT of water. But my stomach has been growling and I could eat a huge burger right now but my fear stops me because I'm terrified of anything making my heart rate increase. 


My question is, has anyone experienced this at all or anything similar? 

I have 2 appointments, one with my PCP and one with a psychiatrist coming up soon so I can find out if there's any underlying issue with my heart.",1579887904.0,1.0,5

"I clicked a link from a 9 year old thread on accident and now I'm terrified, any help?","About an hour ago I was in class on r/askreddit and was bored so I looked up useful websites in the search bar and found a thread with over 400 comments so I went to check it out. I was scrolling and saw a link to this site that the parent comment said was fast ad-free weather report using your IP address, I'm guessing I clicked on in with my touchpad on accident cause a new tab opened and it sent me to some chinese website filled with chinese text, and the tabs name was Chinese characters, I closed out of it without clicking anything else and scrolled back up the thread and saw it was a 9 year old post and I'm very anxious, like I'm having thoughts like ""what if the host of the website has my IP and is tracking my address so then they can kidnap me"" and things like that, and it's really annoying.

So like what if you’re depressed and want to talk to someone but it’s not an emergency?,"I’m not talking like crisis prevention stuff, I mean you’re having a bad day over minor things, your friends/family are busy (I really only have one major Internet friend), and you don’t just want to shout your problems into the void.

homeschooled antisocial idiot. i really need advice.,"so this might be long and i doubt anyone will take the time to read it all, but it would mean a lot of you did to really understand my situation and maybe possibly help me as i’m in dire need of it. i also would very much appreciate if this was taken somewhat seriously and not laughed at... 

so basically, my whole life i have been homeschooled. i’m really shy and i struggle with terrible social anxiety and some depression which has been making being able to talk to people, meet people, socialize like a normal person almost extremely hard for me for the last maybe four years? and i don’t know what to really do about it. all this baggage has caused a lot of people to completely ghost me and it really hurts but this is just who i am. for about like two years now i’ve been searching for someone that could understand me or at least learn to, help me, not think i’m insane or just dumb...

i absolutely dread going out and the thought of engaging with other people that i do not know terrifies me and my chest feels really weird. people tell me i care too much about what other people think of me and yea maybe i do but i can’t stop myself from overthinking about messing up or making a complete fool out of myself and never hearing the end of it.

every weekend my family goes out for dinner and depending on how many people are at the restaurant, i either eat it like i haven’t ate in days without a single fuck to give, or i end up taking it all home, reheating it and eating it there where there’s no one to stare at me or judge me that i do not know. or sometimes i just try to find a sit all the way in the back where i don’t have to face other people.

if i do not do these things i will end up hyperventilating, sweating, shaking and overthinking so bad.

people want to call me sometimes on the phone and i either make up excuses as to why i cannot, or when i actually do want to talk i’m really quiet and don’t say much unless asked a question and even then my answers are short, sometimes i say “i don’t know” when really i do i’m just scared to state what’s exactly on my mind because i start blabbering and stuttering when i’m nervous and my mind just goes blank, i sound so boring and shy & i hate this so much! i feel like it makes people think i’m an idiot and they leave...

there’s not much i want more in life right now then a good friend. someone i can just call everyday and not feel like i’m being this big bother, someone who understands and is willing to help me overcome this, but i don’t even carry the ability to do so. so, i’m slowly accepting that most likely, i’m gonna be alone forever. it’s hard, but when you are this bad off i guess there’s not much you can really do. i could go on and on all day about all the crazy and weird shit my anxiety causes me to do but i already sound insane and whoever is reading this is probably laughing their ass off which is understandable. i would too. i guess that’s it so any advice or anything at all would be nice. have a good day.",1579886608.0,0.81,2
Broke down in class today,"I like to do my work in the morning a few hours before class to keep it fresh. I woke up later than I meant to and was stressed about getting it all done and getting to class on time. Then I couldn’t find the classroom and walked in late. I couldn’t prevent the tears and tried to silently wipe them away but my sniffling got too loud so I asked to go to the bathroom. On my way out I did that snort thing you do when you cry and basically broke down before the door even closed. So now I’m in the bathroom sobbing and I couldn’t breathe for a solid two minutes.

It wasn’t an anxiety attack, but it was intense. I just need someone to remind me that I’m not a worthless mess. I’m in college ffs, this shouldn’t be happening.",1579886457.0,1.0,2
I feel so much live for the people around me but I'm so afraid to show it,"My parents would probably describe me as someone who's kind of a loner. What they don't know is that I've got a lot of friends at school that I hang out with all the time. My year has about 80 people and I've had a conversation with almost all of them. I could go sit with any one of them and it wouldn't be weird. And even outside my class I make friends. Just random people I do projects with, teachers, everyone. I feel more at home there than I do at my house. 

But all that doesn't really take away from the fact that I still find it hard to socialize with people. I often get very nervous when meeting new people but when I'm actually with them it's really fine. I get anxious about joining a group of people that I know are good friends of each other, even if I know some of them well. I get anxious about people who show they want to be friends with me. I get anxious to really feel love for them. 

I'm busy doing a project right now where I knew nobody. But after even one week of intense contact I'm already good friends with two people and I can talk to anyone. But just showing them that I care for them, that I think of them too, is just so hard. I never just text someone something I think they will like. Even if it's a topic that person showed real interest in, I'm like nah, probably shouldn't do that or I'll give off the wrong signals. I'm so afraid of giving them a wrong impression of my expectations of them that I'd rather just distance myself than show them I care.

I hate the fact that these people feel more like my family than my actual family, but I can't tell them. I can't show them my love, or any emotion really, because of how scared I am.",1579886436.0,1.0,0
Diagnosed with Acute Anxiety Disorder -- do I deserve to get fired?,"I work for/at a university. I've missed so many days of work already this month, due to this anxiety issue I'm dealing with. I was at the doctor's office yesterday -- she put me on EFFEXOR (took me off Lexxapro which wasn't doing a damn thing for me), and took me off work yesterday and today. But I am dreading Monday morning. I can tell my boss is getting sick of me calling in... he's been plenty accommodating. But I'm worried he's going to start thinking I'm taking advantage of him. I've called in quite a bit, even with doctor's notes -- I go in, they see me, they put me on a medication, I go back to work, and continue to suffer. I even went through this last year, when the doctor was trying out different SSRIs on me. I still missed a ton of work. But my anxiety symptoms are often debilitating, to the point where I often can't even get out of bed... and this is happening more and more often. Towards the end of last year, my boss suggested that I look into going on short-term disability while I get this issue dealt with... that way I don't keep missing work, piecemeal, and I won't have to use up all of my paid time off. And, presumably, he can come up with a gameplan to cover for me to ensure the job gets done and my absences don't create such a disruption. But I don't foresee the doctor being okay with this. I'm not okay with it either, I WANT to go to work! But short-term disability may be my only option to save my job, until the Effexor starts doing its thing, and hopefully helping my anxiety. Ideally, I'd then be able to return to work with my anxiety under control. But if not that, and if the doctor doesn't approve, then what? I'm just so lost right now, I don't know what to do. I'm so worried I'm going to get fired, and of course that makes things even worse.

I think I’ll just attend it but work by myself since I can’t even concentrate working with other people due to my nerves. It’s so fucking annoying having this engrained  anxiety cause I’m not shy I just feel so much shame about my existence and feel so inferior so every social interaction with people leave me assessing my capabilities.

I had my first good shower in 2.5 years!!,"So this is one of the few happy ones here currently, I just had my first good shower in about two and a half years! Normally I feel like I'm passing out and dying over and over throughout the shower which is why I usually have 2 min max showers, with very little water pressure to minimise 'heavy' feeling of passing out and use little shampoo to be quick, leaving my hair kinda knotty etc but still clean.

 Anyway this time I felt great throughout the shower, I used full water pressure and even closed the shower door which I usually don't do for fear of something or other, maybe lack of help. I also super washed my hair a few times to really clean it and just chilled in the shower for a while! 

I now feel really good! Progress!

First experience,"The last 5/6 months I have had what I can only describe as “ anxiety attacks”. I have never experienced anything like this before. It’s like a wave of doom comes over me, so strong it can stop me in my tracks. I could be watching TV or at home getting out the shower and it will hit. To preface, I got married 3 months ago and had an extremely stressful experience planning and during the wedding ( family issues on both sides) and I bought a house 11 months before this, and it was a shit show. I don’t know if this is residual stress or whatever but physically the symptoms of anxiety are horrific. I’m having back spasms and my throat feels like there’s a constant lump in it and someone is chocking me. Every solitary member of my family has suffered with anxiety, my father had a nervous breakdown my mother and two sisters dose themselves on lexapro and Xanax. I’ve never experienced it to their degree, but kind of fought it away throughout the years and never was overcome physically with anxiety like now. It’s come to a point that I need to address it, but where do I start? I started back therapy last week and since then they’ve gotten worse. I took some time off work, and have had anxiety attacks every day that week. I’ve been to two doctors who have both shooed me away with antibiotics for my throat. What’s scaring me more if that I feel nobody can help me, to the point of panic. My husband doesn’t get it all, which makes this even more frightening. How do you manage the anxiety attacks and prevent them from happening? Did anyone else have huge physical responses ( like throat) it is this something physical in me? Feel like I’ve been dropped out the sea in the middle of the night and left there alone. Any little thing I read in the news of watch on TV triggers it. Could be something as simple as a storyline on a soap opera about someone dying and I’m set off. I’m hiding it a lot from my new husband as he doesn’t understand and that makes it a whole lot worse!

Feel really really sick to my stomach,"When I was a little kid I used to go to summer camp and I went to one that my school hosted and I used to always feel sick to my stomach and I would cry because I don’t want to be throwing up and having diarrhea while I’m all alone with people I don’t really know. I think my parents thought it was because they thought that I missed them. It wasn’t really too bad because I had some friends there. The worst time it was when I went to this basketball summer camp and it was really really bad I would feel sooooo sick and I would pretty much cry for the whole morning and I couldn’t eat. My whole family still teases me about that saying that I didn’t like the kids and whatever. But from what I remember I didn’t mind the kids like I would just feel really sick to my stomach and I would cry but around the afternoon idk why but I would feel better and I got along with the kids. I always thought it was just morning sickness but then I started feeling really anxious lately and I would feel the same way. Today I was at work and for no apparent reason I had diarrhea 3 times and I just felt really sick.. honestly there was no reason to feel anxious but I still did. I honestly don’t know what to do about it. This more of a rant but has anyone found a way to overcome this? I’ve left work probably like 5 times because of this. I hate it I’m and I feel so powerless I know I’m not really sick to my stomach but I know I kind of am.

"Random Anxiety ""Spree""?","27M, and for the past week I've been having anxiety trouble that came out of nowhere.

The last time I had panic attacks, was back when I was in middle school, (15+ years).

How to live a normal life with a chronic anxiety disorder? [H E L P :( ],"Hi guys! 

I'm in my mid 20's and for the past 6 years, I been living with chronic anxiety. The thing is that I've been trying to live a ""normal"" life. You know, working hard for school grades back in college, getting a job after that, being as good as I could at my job, having a stable relationship, going out with my friends, etc 

The thing is that in the end after achieving each of the goals I realized that actually, my anxiety is getting worse. I feel like i'm living this metaphor: you are going to a gym and lifting the heaviest set of weights, and with a lot of determination you end up lifting them, but when you put the weights down your arms are shaking and your muscles are broken, why? because you did not have the strength to lift that amount of weight safely. 

So now my friends are telling me I should just take it easy and stop working and stuff and focus on getting better. But I feel like such a failure, scared of losing time and opportunities getting better, and then going to the world healthier but older and with no career or stability, I mean these are my years of youth. So I'm wondering if you guys have done or know any ways to keep my normal life (that involves a lot of career stress-related) while getting better or without getting worse?",1579881418.0,0.76,3

Need advice on my first step,"I am hoping someone can get me pointed in the right direction because I’m not sure where to even start.

Anxiety affecting college/life,"I'm 25 M. This will be a lot of rambling/providing background, sorry. Ever since sixth grade I've had anxiety that manifests as a gag reflex. Might be worth noting when I was younger I've had a few vomiting in school experiences, and supposedly a doctor said something to my mom about me possibly having ADHD when I was a little kid but I never officially was diagnosed with it or anything. But in sixth grade, I knew I was gay by that point and I used to have a very feminine/easy to make fun of last name coupled with that. Which was kind of a giant recipe for disaster. Because of the unwanted attention, meanness from peers and whatnot - I started really disliking school (and loving sleep around that time). I left a public middle school and went back to my old K-8 school because the animosity was too much. In general I wound up missing more school days than usual. When I'd be in school I'd get a nagging gag reflex. To combat it, I would bring cereal in a baggie or chew gum which wasn't allowed. It was a Catholic school, and personally church and school just weren't places I wanted to be ""stuck in"", I would rather be home playing video games/having fun or something. Sometimes flight urges will kick in and that's how I end up panicking and wanting to ""get out"" or bolt for the door but obviously I can't be doing that in the middle of class.

Also, every other weekend I would go to my Dad's house which was a really toxic environment. Meaning every other week I would go to school M-F, go to my Dad's Sat-Sun and go right back to school Monday, with nearly no time to relax my mind except Friday and Sunday nights, which were both tainted with thoughts of: ""I have to go to my Dad's tomorrow"" on Fridays or ""I have school this week again starting tomorrow"" on Sunday. I know that's normal but other kids without divorced parents got every single weekend as free time and I'm sure it adds up. Instead, I have to go sit for 24 hours with an evil woman who hates me and my mom because we're affiliated with my Dad, plus her bunch of children from her previous marriage who are just as psychotic and ill-mannered as she is. It wasn't enjoyable, the opposite, and I had no comfort zone.

I went by my middle name as my last name in a public high school, but some people in my hometown still knew me and word about my real name would get around sometimes. It wasn't as bad or direct as in middle school though where kids lacked a filter. There was a guy I took a strong liking to quickly Freshman year (he was like my rock that year for even attending most days since he was my crush), but he was straight and by Junior year he ended up being one of the worst offenders at the school for making fun of my name, completely unaware of how I felt about him. Sophomore year, he wasn't in any of my classes and I was the closest to depression I had ever been, only for him to treat me pretty unkindly the next year. Overall, the work got harder and the days got longer. You're outside at like 8:30am for the bus and don't get home until 4pm. I really don't know how I did it, but I missed a lot of days. I tried everything from gum to tic-tacs to saltine crackers to sun chips to hard candy mints, constantly switching it up. The gag reflex persisted through high school and even in the years after.

Except I didn't go right back to college. I skipped the first year as I felt I needed time off and I felt badly/embarrassed because it's not really socially acceptable. You get asked over and over what you're going to be doing for college by everyone. I didn't have an answer for that either. Being gay and not open about it at the time, I hadn't kissed anyone before, there were so many things I didn't get to do in my life yet that were sort of normal for other people to do as teenagers but I was 18/19. So anyways, I tried to go to school again when I was 20ish, but I registered so late my schedule would have been crazy, scattered hours. So I ended up backing out. My family also had ideas of planning to move soon. I stopped going to my Dad's house. My grandmother who raised me passed away from Alzheimer's, she forgot who I was by the time I graduated, and both my dogs passed too.

I took more time off (extended adolescence) and the only times I would get said anxiety would be if I had to go out in public or eat out/at a table with family, especially if a table is cramped. Eventually we moved out of state when I was 23. Being away from family basically entirely was kind of the last nail in that coffin. I get a little anxious if I'm in public and have to sit and wait in one spot (doctor's office, dentist, hair cut etc.), but for a while the feelings had gone away. Maybe I'd pop a tic-tac for the hell of it, but I didn't need to rely on anything. After moving especially, being out in public in general was easier. I wouldn't get anxious if I was meeting a guy for a date or whatever. I was comfortable at home and didn't need to go out much. I was happy that I was living my life, had free time and was getting the chance to ease my mental health.

Except I'm 25 and hadn't been to college or worked, so I'm pretty behind the curve. There are men my age who are married, have children, have jobs, degrees etc... So I just started college the other day and my major is engineering. My schedule is early and only 3 or 4 hours long depending on the day. But the classes are a chore to sit through. It's also in an area I'm not originally from. The first day wasn't so bad, but my history class on the second day is a cramped classroom, with lots of people and tiny desks. The professor is strict, unwelcoming and told us that if we ever leave to use the bathroom we shouldn't come back. I don't do that in school anyway, but not having the option doesn't make me feel any better. Suddenly I was right back in high school and now it feels like all the time taken off to heal didn't really solve the issue. I want to be strong and see the class through as much as I want to drop it and honestly still might, and now I'm also having second thoughts about it all too...though I have made it through the first week of classes. I just feel like I've gone backwards or like I don't have a choice. Which is silly, it's not that bad and the hours are so short unlike high school, but I'm beyond miserable in a school environment. That's just me. Now: my stomach turns/get nervous gas, my hands get sweaty, my mouth gets dry, my heart beat quickens, my gag reflex might start acting up, I can't stop fidgeting, I tense up. I just keep thinking there must be something else I can do in life so that I don't have to subject myself to something I hate doing. But my family/everyone is proud of me that I'm going to college for this, and so am I in myself on some level. I'm having seriously conflicting thoughts though and yeah there's pressure for sure too, which will only get worse from here as I get more work to do. The new routine is also a bit of an adjustment but I don't think that's the cause of the anxiety I'm getting now.

I saw a doctor recently though it wasn't mainly about my anxiety. But he did say I have it (lol clearly) and I was taking Clonazepam and Escitalopram for a bit. I didn't think the latter did anything for me. I plan on powering through (like always) as best as I can, but I feel lost, I hate that my anxiety is still present like it is. I seriously struggle to relax. I hate that I may need medication to just...be normal in school for 3-4 hours a day when I feel totally normal when I'm at home? This was a lot of venting, but I also feel like I need some advice. The ""have-to""s of adulthood combined with the troubles from my past, plus being alone are eating at my brain. I'm having trouble feeling good about the future, even though I don't think I have much to be worried about, my mind sadly struggles to get past unwanted thoughts. I don't know how other people put up with doing something they don't want to. I suppose they take it out on those around them, but I'm not like that as a person.",1579875373.0,1.0,2

Strange tingling/burning in feet and hands. Anyone else?,"About 6 weeks ago, I started getting a tingling/burning/prickly feeling in my feet. Sometimes it would feel like mild itching with the prickling feeling. It sometimes is in my hands too, but mostly the feet. 

I went to my doctor who ordered a blood test which included a blood glucose, thyroid and b12 test. All of it came back normal and now she’s referred me to a neurologist to have a nerve conduction test done. 

I am pretty worried at this stage as all of these symptoms point to nerve damage. Does anyone else have any experience with these symptoms?",1579873396.0,1.0,2
Feeling overshadowed & anxious at my new job,"So I’ve started a new job recently, (don’t get me wrong I love my new job and where I am), but I started at the same time as another girl who has also joined my department. 

She’s lovely and we get along but I feel like she is overshadowing me in terms of getting along with people and just stepping on my toes with work (I’m ‘one’ above her) which is bringing out my anxiety and making me feel like I can’t be myself. 

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety towards the end of last year and my biggest trigger was worrying about things too much and the situation I mentioned above is making me worry about how I’ll be perceived, if I’ll make friends, if I’ll succeed etc.

Panic attacks while driving?,"I’m not the super good driver that can weave in and out and that sorta thing, but I am a very very very safe driver. The whole “your car is a weapon that can kill people” is very ingrained in me, I’ve literally never gone over the speed limit in my life (for me personally I just think it’d be so entitled and selfish of me to put people in danger to get somewhere early when I should have had my shit together and left earlier sorta thing - no judgment if you speed or whatever it’s just not my thing). Have driven for like 3 years I think now, that’s sort of my experience with driving. 

For me, my big problem is that if I take a wrong turn or something, or my GPS signal messes up for a minute and is being weird, that’s when I start to panic, and start crying and stuff because there’s been times where I just get completely lost and have no idea where I am as a result of me not staying on route, especially when I accidentally get on to a freeway or something and can’t pull over. Like I’ll just start doing silly things like trying to cut into the correct turning lanes and stuff which just holds up traffic behind me and makes people honk their horns and flip me off and whatever which just makes me meltdown even more. (Fucking up) Driving just seems to be a massive trigger for me. 

For context, I am on multiple medications for mental health, have been in therapy for years, have a lot of other issues like self-harm and BPD and more, still struggling like 70% of the time lol rip. I was hoping if anyone has ever has had similar issues with driving they’d have any tips or ways they hold it together, because obviously freaking out while driving is so so so dangerous and is the last thing I ever want to do is put someone else’s life at risk.",1579871284.0,1.0,2

Feeling guilty that I can't support my wife in her time of need because I'm reliving my trauma. She is a rock though and very calm. But I feel that maybe she would confide in me more if I was more stable. 

Going back to therapy today but don't know what the answer is. We are fine from a financial, insurance sense as I have a job and savings.

Having a panic attack worrying about diabetes,"Right now I'm currently having a panic attack I'm fat I have been trying to lose but ended up getting sick for 2 months from pneumonia and chest pains so what weight I lost I more than likely gained back and more I was in an elevator when these 2 ladies started talking about one of their diabetes and one didn't know the symptoms and asked her what tipped her off to get checked out and she said frequent peeing, really thirsty, pain in hands or feet and all I could think was I've had majority of those. I'm trying to think logically like I only pee a couple of times a day I wouldn't say a lot, I drink a couple of bottles of water and either 1-2 cans of pop, I don't really eat sweets only junk food I really eat is chips and that probably be 2-3 bags a week maybe, I eat celery, carrots, grapes, blue and black berries every week and I haven't ate out except for a pizza in a week. So this has sorta calmed me down until I had to use a flash light to look under something and the light bounced off my thumb nail so I don't know if it was just how my thumb was angled or what but it looked like I had an indent in the nail and I remember my grandma who was a diabetic had those on her nails.

"My panic attacks aren't being very considerate of my work schedule.

I need advice on how people with anxiety but can't medicate ATM deal with stress, anxiety and depression. I understand some of this flies in the face of rule 7 but I'm not sure exactly what to do anymore.

 I do some basic IT stuff, I repair computers, phones and install security cameras along with access control systems, Im slow but only through a lack of experience, I know I can only get better the longer I do it. 
We've slowed down massively and are working from home until we get a new office but despite being in what should be a very comfortable environment, I've had two panic attacks this week and couldn't even properly put on a few rj45 connectors on some cables(4/16 worked) because my hands were too shakey and my coworker basically had to do my work for me. He just had the flu, he has his own life, he shouldn't have to stay back and do my work because I can't get it together. 

Yesterday, I broke down.

Feeling very sleepy on citalopram/celexa?,"Hey,

I’ve been taking 20mg for since mid October 2019 and it’s done wonders for my anxiety. 
However, I am very sleepy. I seem to be sleeping around 9-11 hours if I don’t set any alarm, and still finding it very hard to get out of bed. I’m trying to give myself 9 hours each night, but even when I do I wake up really desperate to go back to sleep. It takes me so long to get out of bed, and even when I do I’m yawning all the time for the next few hours, often only barely keeping my eyes open. 
In general I think I’m getting pretty good sleep- most of the time I’m not waking up during the night. I’m also having some very intense and vivid dreams. 
When I first started taking it, I found taking it in the morning made me feel nauseous and jittery so I switched to the evening. I now take it just before I go to sleep, and no longer get the upset tummy or the anxious feelings.

Anxiety When People Show Sexual Interest In You?,"So.. I have this weird problem.. 

If I had to describe myself I am generally quite innocent, very slow to proceed in relationships etc, with the exception of sometimes switching into a hyper-sexual mood where I suddenly feel quite frisky about sexual stuff, but those are like... once every 1-3 months sorta-thing.. As you can imagine, this creates problems in the kind of hyper-sexual society we live in today.. and it's hard to talk about since most people wouldn't mind having sex or similar on first date it seems.. 

The problem I have and wonder if anyone else has is that when guys show sexual interest in me, show frisky pics and how they want to do stuff to me, my anxiety flares up by A LOT, and especially just now I had a guy record himself on voice while uhm.. doing stuff or almost doing stuff and I just spent 30 minutes calming myself down from a panic attack.. It's that bad.. 

I have become quite asexual lately, but even back when my sex drive was up by a lot and I watched lewd stuff occasionally, I still had this problem.. 

Wondering what to do really.. I don't want to feel this way when sexual stuff happens, but how to approach it.. 

I guess I could just accept it, and hope to find  a partner that wouldn't  mind my super slow and more intimate pacing..? But I do feel broken in a way since it's not really normal.. At least not common it seems..

My life is changing alot and it's making my anxiety flare.,"I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2018, but I've dealt with it probably since before I was a teenager, (I'm 17 now) and it's only gotten worse since then. A good way I found to deal with it is to have a routine. If I know what to roughly expect from my day, I worry about it just a little bit less. When that routine is changed, I just get anxious. My mind feels like it becomes crowded, and everything in my body feels off.
I'm going to turn 18 in a few months and the pressure of graduating high school soon, having to find a job after, and the whole adult thing is just kind of alot for me.
But the big stressor on top of that; my dad has been pressuring me to take a trade school, (something I desperately don't want to do) and how he doesn't support me going to college to become a novelist, which is my biggest dream. And knowing he thinks I'm going to fail at that also causes me worry, cause maybe he is right.

I cut this down alot cause if I went though everything making me anxious we'd be here forever.
And I know I probably sound kinda ridiculous for worrying so much about all of this, and I'm not very good at explaining myself, but I hope some of this makes sense. I kind of just needed to rant about it a little cause I haven't slept well in weeks.

This morning I called the suicide prevention hotline out of desperation to talk to somebody directly and the woman i was connected to just told me a lot of common sense advice that just made me feel stupid about not knowing in the first place. She also said my ADHD wasn't a mental disability which i put a lot of effort into to ignore because of how it marginalized a lot of problems I personally had to experience and put up with throughout my childhood & teen education years as well as university before i dropped out.

My last week comes up and one of the lady’s who makes the schedule comes to talks to me in front of everyone and pressures me into staying once a week on Sundays. I know I could’ve said no but the situation was just so bad and her questions made me feel like I was saying yes already. 

This week I work my shift on Sunday and then today on my way home from school, I saw I got a bunch of text messages time stamped around 30 mins ago by the time I saw it from coworkers and my manager. The main text I got was asking if I’m running late because I was suppose to be coming in a x:xx and stay till x:xx.

I was so scared for a moment and started running to my room when I got home to put on my uniform. I had never agreed to work on Thursdays and they didn’t even know my school schedule to be putting me at whatever time. I know I should’ve looked at the rest of schedule but I only agreed to work on Sunday so I only looked at Sunday and just assumed. 

I start to cry because I didn’t know what to do and was so anxious on what they thought about me now. I also had agreed to help out at my new/2nd job today. I text the people there and they said it was fine and to go to my shift at my original job but at this point I felt like it was so unfair that I already wanted to quit and decided to help them out by staying once a week but they didn’t keep their end of our deal. I am responsible for not looking and telling them ahead of time.

After crying a little, I decided to not show up because it was too late at this point there was only a few hours left on my shift by the time I was at home deciding and had felt that this was out of my control in some sense. I also didn’t text anyone back because I started to feel angry at them so...

 NOW, I don’t know what to do. Do I send a text to my employer tomorrow and explain or wait until Sunday to see what they say in person? If anything goes bad I’ll probably panic and walk out on them. 

(I’ve always want to skip a shift like this but never had the balls to and I was kind of proud of myself because I don’t wanted to be treated like shit at my job twice a week.)",1579850888.0,1.0,1
Feeling good (some tips on how to deal with Shane and anxiety),"Hi everyone, the past year now I have been really struggling with anxiety. I had a few times where I felt like I was getting better but I always seemed to fall back into a pit. I was meeting with a therapist semi regularly but it only seemed to help a little bit. I think my first major step to getting a grip on things came from a discussion I had with this girl I was seeing a few months back. We were smoking weed (I started smoking as a coping method) and I felt I could be honest with her so I admitted weed was making my life worse but didn’t wan to tell my therapist I was still smoking. Anyway the reason I bring this up is because I realized my mane problem isn’t just the anxiety, it’s the shame of looking weird or stupid or in the case of weed like a druggy. It prevents me from actually acknowledging I have a problem because when I release I have to talk to someone to help me get through it I shut down. This took about a month of debilitating anxiety to sink in but now it did I feel like I might finally be making real progress to improving my life!",1579849510.0,1.0,0
I did it! I was able to study for the whole day!,"So, the day before yesterday, I was just thinking of making myself study for the whole day without any distractions. That means not going onto mobile too. 'Cause I'll do anything but study. Everytime i sit down to study, my mind suddenly comes up with various distractions. Usually, I end up playing vid games. Or reading mangas. Or watching some series(I use my mobile for those things. I rarely use my pc anymore). I wasn't serious about actually doing this but when it turned 12 and the new day began, i took it seriously. P.s. I have a huge anxiety for studying, which is why, i developed a habit to avoid studying at all cost.

I studied for a while, slept, again studied. No anxiety while studying either! Yay! Although at the end of the evening, i was being reckless cause i was at limit! But I'm proud that i didn't use my mobile for distractions for the whole day!

I decided to challenge myself again but i slacked off for a while aha. Though, Imma go and try studying for the day again. My finals are in a month and i need to study from scratch. I can definitely do it if I believe in myself. Even if i fail to achieve marks, I wouldn't be disappointed knowing i did put some efforts. I'm happy with that. 

Oh yeah, I don't know why, but i keep getting my anxiety flared up for the past few days. It just suddenly turns so bad, out of nowhere. It's hard calming myself down.. Feels like shit 😭

P.s. sorry if this doesn't make any sense, I tried typing as fast as possible so that i can put down my phone and focus on studying. Yeah, I'm just ranting, haha. I'm just happy😊",1579849332.0,1.0,4

"Reprogramming the brain and mind to ""want"" and ""seek out"" positive social interactions?"," (TL;DR at the bottom)

To  my understanding, dopamine is the chemical in our brains that motivates  and makes us feel a ""want"" for something. ""Feel-good"" hormones and  endorphins are released once we get “the thing” that the dopamine  release encouraged us to get, which in the realm of socializing would be  a release of oxytocin in the brain. Oxytocin is the hormone associated  with successful social bonding, leading to a greater chance of survival  (to our minds which still mainly work in terms of animalistic  self-preservation).

I was sitting  in a college class today feeling anxious until I got excited about going  home and finishing an interesting YouTube video I started watching  earlier. That desire released dopamine. I’ve come to realize that  through a long period of mainly constant negative social interactions, I  have adapted to releasing cortisol (a stress hormone) rather than  dopamine in regards to the possibility of engaging in social  interaction. Positive social interaction can lead to great feelings of  safety, satisfaction and connection... aka feel good hormones like  oxytocin. Releasing dopamine would be the motivator to chase that  endeavour. I've started to wonder if I just need to reprogram my brain  and mind to desire social interaction the same way I desired to watch  that YouTube video.

Since quitting  things like porn, video games and junk food, I've started to realize  that those artificial activities were without a doubt my greatest  sources of dopamine releases (termed ""super-stimuli"" in addiction  science). I've experienced not just a lack of wanting, but a complete  inability to seek pleasure and evolutionary gain through socializing and  meeting new people. This has all resulted from a downward spiral of  negativity combined with super-stimuli that both manipulated my natural  drive for things like being healthy, social and intelligent. This has  led to low self-esteem and depression which has ultimately changed the  way my brain functions, changing my beliefs and motivations towards  certain life aspects.

So, as I was  sitting in class, I told myself that positive social interactions are a  good thing and that I should seek them out. I started to feel less  anxious because I genuinely believed in that thought. I made 3 new  friends in that classroom because interacting with them was no longer  frightening. I actually felt a desire to do so and felt great after I  did. This could have possibly been caused by a (genuine, although  consciously derived) dopamine release, pushing me towards something good  for my survival and prosperity.

TL;DR

I  think a continuous (conscious) cycle of wanting social interaction  (increased dopamine release) resulting in successful social victories  (increased oxytocin release) could gradually reprogram one’s brain (then  mind) to desire socializing rather than fear it, re-aligning their  natural evolutionary drive to prosper by seeking out and maintaining  positive relationships, reducing social anxiety.

Does this seem like a reasonable hypothesis?

Reset sensory overload?,"How do you reset if you have a sensory overload?

Anxiety a personal failing,"My anxiety has fluctuated up and down over the course of my life. There are many things that seem to impact it. Environment and type of work seem to the most. There were times that it seemed almost gone and most people wouldn’t suspect that I had it but it is always there in the background.

I’ve always had in my mind that this is a personal failing. Perhaps there were past experiences where I was bullied for being ‘scared’ and integrated it as part of me or just considered it who I am.

Lately it has become much worse than ever before . My doctor mentioned that it could be because my lack of exercise but I’ve exercised my entire life and it hasn’t eliminated it. He also thinks it is part of my addictive personality and ties back to some traumatic childhood events.

I don’t know what to do as I’m going to a particularly rough time right now and I feel as if I’m too old and if I haven’t beat this by now it may be hopeless.

Need some help with coping methods,"Hey all,

First post on here as I am finally admitting to myself that I have massive anxiety issues. Cant really turn to family as its the old “toughen up your a man” kinda thing.

Anyways I suffer from anxiety anytime I face something new, whether that be a new location, person, or job thing.

It gets really bad whenever I have to talk to someone who does not know me as I feel extremely judged (think first date, presentation, work dinner). It gets so bad that I get horribly nauseous at just the thinking of it, to the point of dry heaving.

Obviously I would like to not do that in front of people, so some advice would be appreciated.

Weird spitting tic?,"Hi.
 
I’m a little embarrassed I’ve only ever told maybe one other person in my life. I have this thing where when I think of anything bad (I have a lot of intruding thought) or even a weird feeling in my mouth I’ll spit. I do my best to do it in a sink, toilet, or anywhere it wouldn’t affect someone else.

Lately it’s gotten very out of hand and I am extremely embarrassed by it. But when I get the feeling I honestly feel like if I don’t something horrible will happen. I don’t really know how to stop or what to do. 

I also tend to lower and raise car windows when I’m driving to avoid spitting. I know it’s strange and not nearly as bad as some things but it’s started to really upset me that I continue to.

Sensory overload? (HSP),"Is anyone else here an HSP? (Highly Sensitive Person) and also suffer from anxiety? 

I suffer from being overstimulated by loud noises very easily (concerts, live music restaurants, arcades) and I’m curious if it’s a common thing for HSP to be linked to anxiety! 

I am also incredibly intuitive, and I pick up on subtle things that make me hyper aware of the people around me. I can tell when someone doesn’t like me and I can often tell when someone is uncomfortable and that makes me overanalyze my behavior when interacting with others. (The plus side is that I pick up on people’s personalities easily which can turn me into one charismatic SOB)

I've finally gotten an official diagnosis.,"Hi. I'm just here to express my relief and to vent.

Since I was a teenager, I have had issues with anxiety. It started out with social anxiety, but after having matured and finding friends who showed their acceptance towards me, it kind of went away. The anxiety didn't, but aspects of it did. I am 21, and I have been trying to get help for years, but I've either gotten rejected because I wasn't ""suicidal"", or because I've been forgotten. The past year, it has slowly worsened. Not a day goes by where I haven't had to run out of class, panicked for no reason other than my overthinking. Not a night goes by where I haven't had nightmares, or woken up with my heart racing -- or even a night, where I haven't been able to sleep. My heart is constantly racing, as if I'm being chased by something. My thoughts work in a constant process of spiraling, always making me expect the worse, or to fantasize about scenarios I fear might happen. These past couple of months, it got to the point where it was crippling. I've had to skip classes because of it, I haven't been able to get school work done because it killed my motivation and focus. I've avoided talking to my friends because it's all I can think about. Nothing has brought me joy. I'm usually a positive and ambitious person, something I came to learn about myself about a year ago. 

Yesterday I had an appointment. I had an assessment done by a doctor through the University I now attend. He understood me, and he said ""You have General Anxiety Disorder"". On Monday, I will be speaking to a doctor who will be able to find me a suitable prescription for medication. I've finally been heard and helped. I've had my mother's, my SO's and best friend's support through all of this, but I've finally found help through somebody that can professionally help me.

The anxiety took over, and I couldn't tell what was real vs. what I had over-analyzed in my head. I lost a part of myself, and I can no longer recognize myself. I think, even through years of having struggled with depression and anxiety, I've reached my peak. Mental illness fucking sucks. It's stolen a part of my life, as well as a part of who I am. I'm finally ready to enter a process for help, and to get back on my feet. Fuck anxiety.",1579841091.0,1.0,2
Help me diffuse negative spirals,"My wife has anxiety, mostly we get by despite it. But I'm really struggling to diffuse negative thoughts turning into spirals and getting dragged into arguments over nothing.

&#x200B;

I feel like the most common sentence I hear is ""BUT WHAT IF..."" (in a very emotionally heightened state). And it could be about anything... her career, our kid, the weather, world conflicts, health, driving a car, bushfires in australia or viruses in wuhan, other people having less than her, others having more than her, just anything can be spun into an irrational negative thought (which I understand she cannot fully control). Answering or reassuring any ""BUT WHAT IF..."" question is quickly followed by another ""BUT WHAT IF..."" question and then another ""BUT WHAT IF..."" and then another ""BUT WHAT IF..."" and another and another and another until my tone becomes more frustrated and the conversation (if thats what you can call it) is turned back onto me for being non-supportive.

&#x200B;

Of course I have to own how I react (I've never done anything regrettable, but I do shift to more and more short and frustrated). But I can't imagine how I can reasonably control my own emotional state and tone when her anxiety is directed directly at me for extended periods of time, as much as I can try, it's like asking me to lift a car. I can only reassure and support so much. But I also don't know how to escape the conversation. I normally know/realize long long before it escalates fully exactly where it is heading but there's nothing that can stop it. Any attempt to highlight she is getting worked up from the anxiety and it's not actually about what university our 1 year old will go to (yeah that comes up often) just fast forwards the process into how I don't support her.

I don’t know why but being put on the spot, especially in front of a large crowd, gives me extreme anxiety.

Quitting Duloxetine (Cymbalta),"** DISCLAIMER ** I highly recommend if you decide to quit your medication prescribed for anxiety, or any mental illness, you consult your doctors. This is not to encourage everyone to quit their meds, or make taking meds seem negative. 

I started on 60mg of Duloxetine daily 3 years ago, in that time my doctor upped my dosage to 120mg daily. I took 120mg daily for about 2 years after being diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and moderate depression. I did not take part in regular counseling or therapy due to my work/life balance and unwillingness to ask for time off for therapy. I chose the medication route due to suicidal ideation, and overall extreme cyclical emotions. 

Now, after about 2.5 years I started considering getting off of Duloxetine. While I am grateful for how it “evened” me out during the first year, after that I noticed that my passion for life became dulled. Getting on the medication affected me physically with shivers, abnormal sweating, insomnia, and adverse reactions to ANY caffeine. 

Due to me being in grad school, working full time, and trying to have a social life, I kept putting off seeing my doctor to get off of Duloxetine. I just felt like the medication, no matter the timing of my dose, made me dull, tired, and lose passion for daily life activities. I gained weight, hardly felt emotion (like sadness, anger, or even healthy stress). I became a robot.

Two weeks ago my refills for Duloxetine ran out and I didn’t have time to schedule a visit for a refill. So I decided “fuck it, I’m quitting cold turkey”. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE QUITTING DULOXETINE. This medication has HEAPS of addictive qualities and will cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms. The first 7 days of quitting cold turkey my symptoms were: insomnia, jittery/shivers and shakes, randomly sweaty, randomly crying, overly exhausted, no appetite, occasional nausea, and “brain zaps”. 

I’m now on day 14 of being off of Duloxetine and now I only really experience the jitters occasionally and small brain zaps. I’ve noticed these symptoms are more obvious if I’m not eating regularly. If I eat regularly and stay hydrated I feel perfectly fine! 

I will say I am shocked on the range of emotions I’m feeling again. The fact I can actually cry again, laugh more, and feel just normal is so relieving.

If you’re reading this because you think you’re ready to stop Duloxetine or maybe you’re dealing with withdrawal and you’re feeling hopeless— it gets better! You CAN do this.",1579840024.0,1.0,4

Then I ended up having a panic attack and ran off stage and hid! I was able to get back on stage and finish the song, but I didn’t perform the next recital because of this, and I have no idea what I should do now!

On top of that, I also used to do improv! I was doing pretty good, but for some reason it felt like I was just getting worse! I still did really well at the final shows that I would have at the end of each of the courses I took, but I wasn’t doing well during the actual classes, and it got me confused and frustrated! Plus the last class I took wasn’t really the best! Most of the classmates I had to deal with were in their 40’s-60’s, and they would not shut up about politics! I never want to hear politics... ever! Sorry for sounding unreasonable, but it makes me anxious as fuck! Needless to say, I didn’t go back for an entire year after that!

I have so much more to talk about that’s bothering, but I hate writing long articles like this, so I’m just going to stop for now, hopefully I didn’t bother anyone!

Also, sorry for so many !’s.",1579837598.0,0.99,0

Embarrassed about moving back home after college,"Hi, this might be really silly and in the grand scheme of things not a serious issue, but lately, it's been a real stressor of mine. I'm anxious about a lot, but this happens to be on the forefront for the time being. After I graduated college, I moved back home with my mom and dad. I am a 22 y/o, so I graduated this past June. They live in the close suburbs of a major city. I have a job and I work quite hard at it (it is not my favorite but it is something) and I am actively looking for other opportunities as well. I help out at home as much as I can. I am also saving a lot of my paychecks by putting them in the bank, so I am financially helping myself for later. My parents are putting the justified and necessary amount of pressure for me to find my next step career wise but they're not harassing me to get out of the house. So, it's not really objectively terrible. However, I can't help myself but feel so embarrassed about it. A lot of people who I graduated with live with roommates in other cities or on their own, and I feel like a total bust. It's so bad it's to the point where I met someone on a dating app in the city, and its been going well, but I am just too embarrassed to admit that I don't live in town and that I have to commute just outside the city to go home. I worry that it'll be enough for people to lose interest in me. To me, I just feel like it's humiliating and that I've failed. I feel like I'm not only ruining my own 20s by not living on my own but also ruining my parents lives too. I don't know, I guess I was just hoping to vent a little and hope maybe that I am not alone in feeling like this. It's nice to have a place to talk about it.",1579832706.0,1.0,3
Any tips to win the fight?,"I don't know if this is the right sub, so I'm sorry in advance.
I'm mentally ill. I have depression, anxiety and social phobia. I know this, because I've been diagnosed few years ago, back when I still had health insurance. I'm not working, I'm not in school anymore, I'm not going out at all. The only two people I talk to are my mom and my boyfriend. I know that I'm lucky to have them and I also know that I don't deserve them one bit. I'm writing this because I don't know what else to do. Every time that I try to go outside, I feel sick, my legs get all wobbly, my shoulders tense and the tightness in my chest gets unbearable. When I actually do manage to go out, it gets even worse, I feel dizzy and lightheaded, and if I'm in a well lit place with other people, I'm on the verge of crying and then I run away. I just can't stand it. Going to the shop is a nightmare, so I haven't been in one in months. I don't want to live like that anymore.
Obviously, there are also other problems. I can't sleep at night, but I have no problem sleeping through a whole day. Which depresses me even more.
I'm disgusted with everything that has to do with sex. When my boyfriend touches me, I want to die. Pornography is the worst, most revolting thing I've ever seen. But I do have sex drive, which makes me feel even worse. Answering the unasked question - no, I've never been raped or sexually abused. My aversion to intercourse, genitals, masturbation, and anything sex-related just happened with no apparent reason.
Eating is another problem. I'm not anorexic or bulimic in any way, but my appetite greatly differs from one day to the other. For couple of days I have to force-fed myself, so I won't go through the day on water and coffee only. Next few days, I eat like a pig, massive amounts of food, often eating till I just can't physically fit even one more bite. I can't  understand this. Why on some days I'm stressed, crying and the last thing on my mind is food, and on other days I'm stressed and crying but I'm eating enough to feed a small village?
I'm sorry, I know I'm just rambling at this point, but I don't know what to do. Psychiatrist and any other doctor is out of question, I can't afford therapy. Is there something I can do myself? Does anyone have any tips? Any tips at all, I just have to do something. If I won't I feel like I'm gonna explode.
The biggest problem is my fear of going out, that prevents me from getting any job, so I'd appreciate any help on that issue. Sorry for long post and bad English - I'm not a native speaker.",1579813779.0,0.99,0
Taoering off fluoxetine (Prozac) 10 mg for anxiety by my PA. Worried about the future. Need hope.,"So in 2015, I decided to go on the SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine for anxiety and while it was a helpful drug for keeping me stable, it gave me some unpleasant side effects. One of which in particular would be sexual dysfunction. I started my taper in late 2019 and should be done in early February. I talked to a psychiatric physician assistant and my primary care physician about whether the sexual side effects would subside after stopping fluoxetine and they both said ""yes, it should"" and ""you shouldn't have sexual side effects for the rest of your life"".

But when someone from Facebook messaged me, they linked to an article from Psychology Today stating that particular side effect can be permanent and that ""not many medical professionals know about it"", and that ""there are many people who have the condition and don't even know the medication caused it"". This scared me and I started to wonder if I should regret taking the medication. I talked to my doctor about it and he said ""Dr. Google is a bad doctor and I have never had a patient complaining of sexual side effects persisting for longer than 3 months off an antidepressant, however I cannot give promises or guarantees"".

I told my therapist something similar and he said that ""even reputable sources can publish inaccurate information to scare people and to sensationalize"".

Didn't get the reassurance I got and I wondered if my life is ruined for good just because I was too foolish about doing therapy.",1579829795.0,1.0,3
I know I'm not alone but I need help and advice of things I can do to prove this to myself to try to be more comfortable in social situations.,"I (22M) haven't been in a relationship in over a year and am living with 2 roommates that are in a relationship, this does not bother me other than it can be very lonely, especially when they need/want their time to just themselves. I understand their side though and have no issues with this, I just don't have anyone I talk to. I am still trying to be open with them about things that happen in my life, or in my head, but most of my life I haven't been able to talk to anyone because I felt like they don't care or because they just don't like to be around me. The few people who used to care I've ended up pushing away, including my family (I've never felt like i can talk to them about anything because when i have tried to in the past the disregarded most of my symptoms as being ""normal"" for my age, or they would just go to the pastor of their church for advice who thought I was just attention seeking (I have not been to that church in many years as it's predominantly older extremely opinionated generations) 

I got lucky and found a job that I enjoy (welding) and have been able to be open with a few of my coworkers about my mental health and sometimes the things I overthink about (though I know it's not good to rely on the people around you for such, it helps them understand why I act reserved or ""strange"" at times, and a couple of them have gone out of their way to try to help me calm down) I can't afford a therapist or to see a doctor for anxiety medication as I don't have health insurance either. 

I need to make new friends or reconcile with some of my old friends that I know I can trust but every time I try to I end up freaking out and just running away (sometimes figuratively) from the situation because I feel like they're judging me or like they don't like me due to many of symptoms I fight regularly. I'm trying to get a friend I can go to a bar or concerts or something with them but each time I go out to meet new people I end up only being around my friend or sitting by myself because I'm to scared to talk to anyone there, especially new people I don't know. I'm also scared that I'll meet some people and get along with them but when they find out about my problems they'll just leave or that I'll push them away as well. 

I'm not really sure what to do about any of this. I'm really tired of being alone and being to afraid or uncomfortable to talk to people, if anyone has any suggestions or things that worked for them that I can try?

Edit: I'm not really sure how to even start a conversation with a complete stranger or once I do start a conversation I'm not sure how to hold the conversation outside of asking them questions about themselves, as most people love to talk about themselves",1579831939.0,1.0,0
Drinking and anxiety,"As someone who struggles heavily with alcohol and is genetically predisposed to alcoholism, I’ve come to realize that the general anxiety I try to kill with alcohol is actually being caused by my drinking in the first place. The cycle is a vicious one: drink heavily in order to dull the panic and intensity of my anxiety, black out, do and say things that are hurtful/harmful/counterproductive to mine and others’ wellbeing, wake up the next day to all of the chaos I caused while blacked out, feel incredibly anxious about it/my lack of preparedness for work and life, rinse, repeat. Since I quit drinking I’ve noticed that my daily anxiety levels have dropped significantly and I haven’t had a panic attack for a long time. To those who suffer dual alcoholism/anxiety, breaking that cycle can make a huge difference. Just wanted to share my experience in hopes that it may help someone else.",1579831285.0,0.9,8

For some reason I'm having intense anxiety when making eye contact with my professors.,"This is a really recent development. I never had this problem before, but it suddenly happened once a couple days ago and now I've been dealing with it since

The first time  it happened, I was at my last class of the day (no problems looking anyone in the eye prior). I was looking at the professor as he lectured when he looked in my direction. For the first couple seconds I was fine as usual but suddenly I just started feeling this intense anxiety which made my neck shake involuntarily, and it caused me to pathetically lower my gaze to my desk while shaking to calm down. What the heck?? 

I was hoping no once noticed, but for the rest of the class I could no longer look at the professor or even put my gaze near his face without feeling an intense anxiety. And the next day I was experiencing this with all of my lectures, even with some professors that I am very familiar with.

What's going on?? I'd really appreciate some advice for this.

Can anybody relate to my anxiety symptoms? Help.,"Ive struggled with anxiety for all my life, it has kept me from continuing to play sports, cancelling plans, traveling, etc.  I feel alone in the way I feel because I cannot relate to anybody else who says they experience anxiety. Maybe I’m not experiencing anxiety at all and it’s something else. Anyway, when I fall into an “anxiety attack,” I completely freeze. I completely freeze and begin breathing very sharply. I can’t help but have the urge to gag and dry heave, and the only thing that keeps me from doing so is slowly sipping water or grabbing a mint.  Taking a sip or chewing a mint only prevents me from gagging/puking, but the urge to do so is still there along with staying frozen and breathing sharply.  After awhile it calms enough where I can walk, but in public people see me and the embarrassment sets in making it worse. This happens multiple times throughout a day and I can never target what triggers my reaction. 

Luckily, there are days where I get through with zero problems, but I just want to hear from the community. Have any of you experienced these kinds of feelings and if so what helps? Medication?",1579829075.0,1.0,1
Today I begin my transition to Sertraline from Cipralex - wish me luck,"About me- I’ve had anxiety and panic attacks for as long as I remember. Over the years I’ve done CBT, seen several psychologists and a psychiatrist. I’ve been on several medications since I was I high school. Most recently I’ve been on Cipralex for about 8 years. I’ve found it hasn’t been as effective over the last few years - especially in the winter. By mid-November I start getting panic attacks nearly daily and sometimes multiple ones in a day. It’s exhausting. 

I saw a doctor who specializes in mental health - his initial conservative plan was to increase my current medication but after 6 weeks there was no change.  So now he has prescribed me 50mg Sertraline and 1mg tabs of Clonazapam to help while I make the switch. 

Last night was my last dose of Cipralex. Tonight I take the Sertraline and buckle in for the next 2-6 weeks and hope I come out better on the other side.  

I have my boyfriend up to speed on what I might experience and how he can help. I am working from home next week and have the support of my work to take sick days if I need them. I have some good books, a new video game, my favourite candle and an empty schedule. 

If you have any tips or recommendations -I’d love to hear them. I’ll update my progress along the way. 

Wish me luck.

DAE feel deathly scared of happiness and success?,"

I have such bad existential anxiety and don’t know how to address it. The emptiness is so scary when things are going good. I crave the chaos so I don’t have to confront that there’s something wrong with my brain. I am also so scared of the rug being pulled from under me.

When everything comes at you at once...,"Hi everyone. 

My anxiety can be pretty debilitating to the point that sometimes I feel the need to be hospitalized. And even that only helps so much. 

I have agoraphobia, panic, GAD, and OCD. 

I start a new job in a week im not sure I will last a week in, but its my first professional job after graduating nearly 3 years ago. I will have to move across town for it which that fact alone makes me anxious. 

But the main thing is this weekend. My last at my current job. My parents will be a few states away and hard to reach by phone, and they are usually my “safety” people. With them around I feel much more comfortable. But all weekend I will be working and both work as well as my time at home is always anxious hell when they are gone. I wouldn’t know who to turn to if I started getting “air hunger” that felt like its driving me crazy. It starts happening, I can’t stop it, and it feels too long to just ride out. Plus I will have to be at work on top of all this. I honestly feel like I am going to die from stress or tension with them gone. Its almost when I don’t have my safety objects or people with me, my brain subconsciously treats it like I am missing something vital like oxygen or food.

How do you compromise with friends?,"Hi all,

I feel very anxious in crowded and loud places - even at a concert for an artist I love I prefer to keep back where it’s not so jam packed. (Also a side note - I gave up drinking to better manage my anxiety)

If you have friends/family/significant others who really enjoy bars and loud parties etc, how do you compromise on what to do together? If a friend was getting married for example and wanted you to attend their stag/bachelorette at a club would you just suck it up and go?

I’m trying to figure out where to have a firm boundary and where to be flexible and I’m curious to hear if anyone’s also faced this dilemma.

My friends are going to a “trad music” festival in a popular bar this weekend and that’s why this questions is swirling around my head. They’re so good about enjoying brunches, plays, exhibits etc with me, I can’t decide if I should join to be a good sport despite knowing its going to be brutal for my senses.

Haircut advice?,"I'm looking to get a completely new haircut but like, it kinda terrifies me. Truth be told, I've wanted this for some years, but the anxiety surrounding it is too much. The actual visit to the barbers isn't a problem at all, I mean, there's some mild anxiety, but nothing I can't work with. It's the way people will react to me. I hate those few seconds after a fresh haircut where someone's noticing something different about you before they go ""you've had a haircut!"". I hate the attention it draws and I'll have to go through that experience with every single person in my life; friends, family, classmates, etc. 

I know realistically it'll be like, 2 minutes of someone thinking ""oh hey he has different hair"" and then not caring anymore. People generally don't give that much of shit. But like, I'd be so worried still.

This is all without even considering how good it looks. If it looked bad.. I genuinely don't think I'd leave my room for a week or two.

I just.. I don't know. I haven't had a new haircut in legit 10 years nearly. I've had the same long hair since I was about 12. I've been worrying about this for so long and made no progress. I think about this nearly every day. I legit managed to tackle the anxiety around getting a tattoo before I've managed to get over the anxiety of having a hair cut lol. How do I get up the courage to just do it? I know the only way to get over it is just to do it, no one else can do it for me, and it'll grow back eventually, but how do I hype myself up enough?",1579822943.0,1.0,4
Suddenly got visibly anxious speaking to customer,"I suddenly got lightheaded and had trouble when speaking to a guest at work.

Advice dealing with having my picture taken in public.,"Hi everyone.

I've dealt with anxiety and depression issues for a while, but it wasn't until last year when a psychologist tried putting labels on them (PDD and some subtype of GAD that I can't remember now). It seems to be getting harder to handle now, but one situation in particular is bothering me more than anything else. People taking my picture in public.

Let me preface this that I know that there's nothing illegal about any of this and it's just a risk you take by stepping outside. I'm looking for coping techniques and/or ways to discuss this with the people involved.

I play a card game at a local store every Friday with some friends I met there. Having a controlled social outlet like that has been overwhelmingly positive. However, it's been causing more harm than good lately as the store keeps taking photos of the group and posting them to Facebook, mostly at prerelease and release events for the game.

It's irrational, but the amount of anxiety I get from this is immense. Once it was bad enough that I think I was on the border of an actual panic attack, or possibly crossed the border into a ""mild"" one - inability to think clearly, breathing issues, electric tingly feeling throughout my body, etc.

I spoke to an employee that I get along with and asked how he thought the owner would react if I talked to him. He said he was sure it wouldn't be an issue and said he'd talk to him for me.

Over the weekend, there was a new event and again I saw the camera come out. Again, pictures on Facebook. Again, anxiety that lasted with me all night.

Sorry for ranting, but I'm just wondering if anyone else here has similar difficulties with this and how they've handled it. I don't really want to go back there tomorrow because of this, but I also don't want to cut off one of my main social lifelines.

-----

Also, for context, this sort of ""phobia"" isn't new to me, just worse lately:  

 * In Grade 6, I ran out of the gym when the class sang happy birthday to me.  
 * Changed to a different restaurant in a food court when I saw TV cameras pointed at the one I was planning to go to.  
 * After injuring my back in a store and resting on a bench outside to try to recover, basically ran at a wannabe-photographer guy when I saw him taking pictures at me, injuring myself even more.",1579817438.0,0.81,0

Where did I go wrong?? Please read and give me your opinion ❤,"What is happening?? Am I going crazy?? I've spent past 4 days NOT sleeping and thinking of where did I go wrong. Please if you have any idea of what I can do or what I did do just help me please. Thank you. 


So 2 months ago my 2 friends I've known for 2 years started to ignore me and I tried talking to them etc. But they just gave me short answers to get rid of me so I gave them the cold shoulder. 


Past 2 weeks I've been ignoring them too, for example: I don't look at them, don't talk to them, do what I have to and leave without ""goodbye"" and without ""hey"" when they arrive. [ we see each other 3 times a week at gym ]


It's hard to ignore people I love but I know that I shouldn't force anything so I didn't and I won't. 
Today we had a session at gym again... No hello, no goodbye, no looks...NOTHING. It feels weird because 2 months ago they would give me a big hug and we'd talk for hours, laugh at our jokes and also they are the only 2 people who stayed with me while I was going through the worst time in my life couple months ago. 


This happened today too: There is this girl who I used to call a friend but not anymore. We used to walk home together since we live in same street and I would tell her everything because I just felt safe and she made me laugh like no one else. She ignored me since I ended up in hospital after a car crash 8 months ago but I accepted that since we weren't really ""close"". Today she didn't go the same street she usually goes but instead she went the other (longer) way just to avoid me. I know that she wanted to avoid me because 1 year ago while we were still walking home together she said "" Let's go this way because I don't want to run into that guy"" And as soon as I saw her go there I immediately remember that day and I knew she wants to avoid me because nobody else was going there where I was since they all arrived in cars and drove home except me and her. 


At work my 3 coworkers I was good friends with...suddenly started to be rude to me with NO REASON at all. For example: I asked what papers I have to sign and one of them said: ""I don't care, figure it out""... That shocked me because usually they would help me with everything. 


This mostly started when:
1.) I drastically lost weight again [I was diagnosed with anorexia 1 year ago but recovered 6 months ago] because I've been through a lot of stress [family problems]

2.) I started to cover up my depression and became ""stronger""

3.) I got a promotion at work 

4.) I stopped opening up to people after I noticed they all ignore me 


Where did I go wrong??....because I tried to make them all happy and NEVER gossiped about any of them or had a fight with anyone because number 1. I don't have anyone else but them , number 2. I can't stand to fight with people I'd give my life for and I don't have the energy to hurt anyone because I have enough problems myself but I try to cover it up. Also I have no family here or any other friends since I moved out 2 years ago and it's been rough... Diagnosed with anorexia, depression, OCD, PTSD and social anxiety...then I had a car crash and almost died... Spent 3 months in hospital with NO contact with anyone but those 2 ""friends"" because nobody didn't care [yes, my family is abusive and that's why I left]... Then I got fired from my previous job... And now I'm trying to figure out my life again.

Does anyone else get this type of dizziness?,"I know dizziness can be a symptom of anxiety, but mine is moreso of... Swaying, I guess?

With my dizziness, I can feel this weird sensation on the bottom of my feet. It's hard to explain, but it kind of feels like I hit a soft spot in the ground. This can be on any surface, even concrete (I work in a jail setting half the day, so there's no ""soft"" concrete or anything. I also feel it on other surfaces like carpet, tile, etc.


I don't know what it is or if it's anxiety related. I guess anything can be. The sensation has gone down a fair amount, but I still suffer daily. I just want to see if I'm not alone and what others may have done.

Social media is starting to get super... not fun,"Over the past few months in one way or another social media has been driving me slowly up the wall. I've never experienced this before with social media and only recently has it been flaring my anxiety up to the point i'm starting to consider if I need to either delete my accounts all together or go and see my doc again, it's horrible.

I end up making myself sick from seeing tweets about cheating, world events, thinking far too much into friends tweets etc. I took the first step this week and muted some accounts, unfollowed some people and followed some happier accounts but honestly I feel a serious issue is starting to arise from obsessing over it. I'm not one to post either, i'm more interested in keeping up to date with the news and watch cute videos etc... but i keep finding myself being triggered with this horrendous anxiety in me. It doesn't help that twitter shows liked tweets either, thing is i don't mind 90% of them.

Facebook is also causing some serious issues, going back and reading stuff that has no baring on my own life anymore but i end up making myself super sad about it.

My anxiety was slowly creeping up before I realized it,"I got Mirtazapine prescribed 5 days ago and so far I've been having weirdly ""real"" dreams with it. I'm scared but weirdly hopeful. I've realized that my anxiety is much better during the summer where I wouldn't even describe myself as anxious, maybe socially awkward.

It's a bit weird, but my anxiety started kicking around 3 months ago in a very subtle way. Mostly just existential panics 5 minutes before bed. Then it became 5 hours before bed. My life was going pretty normal, all things considered, but I started adding unnecessary changes in my life. Mostly starting drama with people, or contemplating leaving my relationship. I'm not sure but it gave me something to think about. It felt as if I was given something to do. As a result, it felt like my existential dread dissipated.

But now, I've just been irrational with friends accompanied by mood swings. On some days it feels like I have a plan of action. On other days, I'm swamped, feeling paranoid or upset or angered. I work out every other day, and on those days I feel mostly normal. I know there are definitely coping tools that work for me, but on those off days, they don't work much when my anxiety is in overdrive. On most days, I can identify when I'm feeling irrational. Some days I can stop myself from acting on it; on other days I give in.

Anyways, I felt like my anxiety snuck up on me. During those early days, when I was first experiencing existential thoughts, I took it as a sign that I should do more with my life. I don't know. In hindsight, I should've realized that my anxiety was creeping in. It would have saved me from starting a lot of unnecessary drama. I feel disappointed in myself that I didn't realize my anxiety sooner.

TLDR: Anxiety caught me off guard, making me realized that I've been acting irrationally. I'm mostly just want to hear if anyone has ever had similar experiences. Also if anyone has taken Mirtazapine, what were your thoughts on the drug?",1579815367.0,1.0,4

"A Plea for help regarding my Daughter 13yo, Anxiety and a recent event at school UK","First a little background, my daughter was diagnosed with anxiety and we have been making steady headway helping her to cope over the last few months. On top of the anxiety she is also scared of the dark and self harms when stressed. The school have, to say the least, been not very helpful with many minor issues over the last year or so.

Moving on to tuesday of this  week, she had really struggled to get her self together to go to school but she loves learning and is willing to push through and see how things go. Around mid morning I received a text from her saying she wasn't doing well and heading for the ""safe zone"" that she has been designated for when she needs to get herself together at school. A few minutes later another text from her saying ""I don't like this I'm in a box"". We have found a good way to help her is to keep things light so assuming she meant a small room I replied ""well could be worse, it could be a cardboard box!"" the reply was instant, ""it is a cardboard box"".

She had gone to the teacher, a member of the safeguarding staff at the school and asked if she could go home as she was really bad, the reply was ""No you can't go home do you want to go in the box""

She had no idea what the box was  but it was now in her words the only option open to her so they put her in the box. She was crouched in the box head bent and it was then covered with a blanket, pitch black! Very distressed.

To cut a long story short it took around 30 mins from the initial text for my SO to rescue her and we have withdrawn her from the school. Local Child Protection were contacted (by us) who were appalled.

The school have stated that this is a ""recognized calming technique"" and are backing the teacher, Child Protection disagree, everyone I have spoken to about this are shocked. I have searched online for the last 2 days trying to find any reference to this kind of  ""therapy"" and drawn a blank.

So my question is, has anyone out there heard of this, am I wrong to think this is cruel?

Thank you for reading so far.

This is the email I received from the school (Names have been changed to protect the innocent/not so innocent)

 Dear Mr OP  
As requested I am emailing you a summary of our conversation on the phone today (22/01/2020) regarding the incident reported to school this morning in relation to your daughter .   
As I said on the phone the 'box' Daughter went into yesterday is a space developed by some of our students who access the  Centre which is our nurture provision in school. It is, as you know, made from a cardboard box and a blanket and was developed by some of our students who suffer from sensory overload who wanted a quiet, dark space to go to when they need a space to calm in. I explained also that this space was the chosen safe space for some of our students who suffer from anxiety and they choose to use this at times when they too need a quiet non-stimulating space. The ASD team who work with school are aware of this space and understand that it supports some of our ASD students when they are suffering from anxiety.   
Daughter has accessed support in the centre for a number of months now and has developed, up until now, positive relationships with the two staff who work in there. I have spoken to both members of staff in relation to what happened yesterday and what lead to Daughter spending time in this space.   
Staff reported that Daughter arrived at the  centre upset and having an anxiety attack. When she arrived there was a group session in the  Centre involving other students. Daughter arrived saying she wanted to go home. Mrs Boxputter said to Daughter that she shouldn't go home but she could go in 'the box' if she wanted and use the calm app on her phone to help her with her anxiety. At this point Daughter went into the box. Staff left Daughter as they believed she was using the calm app to help with her anxiety and didn't want to interrupt this, at no point was Daughter told she had to go into the box or she couldn't come out at any time and at no point did Daugher say that she didn't want to do this.  
As discussed on the phone the intention behind suggesting Daughter using the box was purely to support her in managing her anxiety. As I also explained we have students who do sometimes arrive saying that they want to go home due to anxiety but after a period of time in the  Centre they have often changed their minds and are fine to continue with the day.   
Daughetr has developed a good relationship with Mrs Boxputter who is both upset and surprised that Daughter feels that she couldn't say she didn't want to go in the box when it was suggested and also that she felt that it was a punitive rather than a supportive suggestion.  I recognise that she was having an anxiety attack at this time but equally she has received support from Mrs Boxputter and the  Centre when she has felt this way in the past and has been able to speak with the staff there at these times.   
I have suggested that we work together with Daughter, Mrs Boxputter, yourself and Daughters Mum to rebuild the trust and relationship that Daughetr and Mrs Boxputter had as I am sure if Daughetr understood that the intent was supportive and not punitive then she may be able to re-build this with both members of the Centre.   
I am happy to meet with you in school to discuss this further and as I know you have spoken to the Local Council Safeguarding Children Team I am also happy to discuss this with them if you wish to pass on my contact details.   
Please let me know if you would like to arrange a meeting next week to support Daughter in coming back to school.  
Kind regards   


The school seem to be the only ones who think it is OK to, put children in a box and claim it is used voluntarily by students with anxiety. I find their excuses hard to believe.

As an anxiety sufferer myself I can not even begin to understand how this would help me or my daughter, I see anxiety as a need to flee and being trapped would only escalate the situation.

My reading of their email seems to say to me that the school treats all mental health issues with broad strokes. Because they claim it helps students with ASD it must help with anxiety also.

The biggest joke of all, to complain about the school and get something done about this I first have to complain to the school and go through their long winded complains procedure!!

An average day at the grocery store...,"So to clarify, I haven't had to go into a store and shop in months because I use curbside pickup, or the wonderful Boyfriend. 

Let me tell you what, as someone with anxiety either things got worse because I wasn't forced to use those social skills or I simply forgot how hard it was. 

Walking into the store there were ladys standing in my way, so I walked through a rock bed and nearly twisted my ankle, worrying the whole time that everyone was looking and I should have just walked in front of the cars. Then there was someone walking too close behind me, so I sped up, but they sped up and we were going to get to the carts at the same time. I wanted to make sure we didn't go for the same cart. Whep! We didn't. But then she pulled out in front of me and stopped to fiddle with her purse. We were so close to the door that it would block everyone to go around her, but it was awkward to just stand behind her. Que my brain screaming at me to make a damn decision. 

Finally in the store, I know what I need, but I don't normally shop at HEB so I don't know where ANYTHING is at. Fuuuuuuck. So I walk the aisles looking at the signs, everyone is staring at me, they know I don't belong in this store. The cart is still empty I could walk away now. Nope, need this shit for tomorrow. 

Finally find the candy isle, THANK GOD. Why are there so many people in this damn isle!? Find what I need, grab two bags, start thinking I may have the wrong stuff. Have to text Kaitlyn to ask what candy she likes, look for the gummy bears just in case. FUCK! Who puts gummy bears on the top shelf!? This older gentleman pulls his cart right up beside mine blocking the entire aisle, including the guy coming towards us. So I backup and pretend to look at juice so he can get through, but turns out the other guy was blocking what he needed. This situation that has nothing to do with me is getting to stressful, I physically started feeling anxious at this point. Finally the guy grabs what he needs and leaves, Kaitlyn texts back, thank god she didn't want gummy bears cause I woulda had to climb the shelf and who knows how long I would have had to wait for that isle to be empty! 

Almost done, just need breakfast drinks, que everyone being in the way and me buying yogurt because people were staring at me for pretending to look at it while they were in my way. 5 minutes of waiting near the milk, SCORE, everyone leaves I grab what I need and headed to checkout. 

Count stuff in my basket...SHIT 11 items, can't use express checkout so imma have to wait behind the people with full ass carts, this is getting bad. Look up and realize they're 15 item express lanes!!! Smile like an idiot, get in line. The girl puts the divider behind her stuff for me. Do I thank her? Shoot that's weird...ok I'll smile if she looks at me. She looks, I smile, she didn't smile back. Now this is awkward as hell. Ohmygod could this checker be any slower...Finally my turn she asks me if I want to buy tide pods cause they're $2 off, I die because I awkwardly refuse. I'm literally crawling inside myself at this point. Near panic attack. I checkout and couldn't get out of the store fast enough. Go to put my cart up and the cart guy makes eye contact and says ""I'll take that"" super nice guy, but I'm past the point of social abilities so I half awkward smile and give him the cart while looking at the floor. 

So ya know, when people laugh at anxiety or any type of invisible mental health problem, I get pissed. And when people who don't actually have anxiety and say things like ""Oh yeah I get anxious too"" realize it's not just being uncomfortable, it's SO much more.

Death Anxiety - Suggestions,"Hi, I'm suffering from an anxiety for death. I'm not scared of dying soon or anything, but more the thoughts of possible nothingness after death. The idea that I'll never exist and I won't have any memories and there aren't any meaning to what I do in this life because at some point, im just gone, gone forever, and I'll never ever have a conciousness again. I've suffered from this all my life, but the last couple of years it has gotten worse and worse, I get panic attacks where I run around, hyperventilate, yell in frustration, hit things including myself to get it out. I yet haven't found any way to help reducing/stopping it. I've tried stuff like acupuncture, weed and psychologist. But I'm still struggling hard, I've never met anyone with this type of anxiety, so my question is: Are there anyone in here with similar problems? And have you found a way to reduce/stop it? If you have, please give me recommendations cuz im quite desperate. Thank you in advance.",1579814319.0,1.0,4
Anyone else just feel so overwhelmingly lonely because of their anxiety?,"Sometimes there's little things I can't do because of my anxiety. Sometimes it's something like asking a stranger for directions, sometimes it's as small as driving a friend to their appointment. I admit, it gets in the way sometimes, it just feels like no one else understands that the small things they can do everyday feel like life or death to me.

For as long as I can remember, I've been yelled at, called incapable, stupid, unreasonable for not being able to complete small tasks. I try my best most of the time, but some things I just cannot do, no matter how much I tell myself it's alright. Does that mean I'm not worthy of respect or compromising? I don't think it does, but most neurotypical people just don't understand how my mental illness affects me. 

It feels so lonely. Like I'm the only one in my little bubble, and no matter how hard I try I cannot get anybody to understand how much it affects me. I agree I need to see a therapist, but at the moment I don't have insurance, so I only have me myself and I to help me with my struggles. Every time I bring it up to friends or even my partner, they just don't understand. It causes huge arguments (which undenianly cause my anxiety to worsen), and no one ever listens to me. 

Sorry for rambling haha, I was just curious if anyone else feels this huge sense of loneliness. Like it's just you. Even if you have a support group who listens, they'll never truly understand what you go through.",1579813970.0,1.0,0

"It’s okay that I am overwhelmed in school, right?","I’m pretty stressed with school right now.

I missed one day last week already and my professor is very boisterous and loud (not necessarily bad but I think our personalities clash a bit). Anyways he kind of called me out for it and has been sort of rude to me since then. 

I was looking ahead in the syllabus and noticed we have two major group projects coming up in February, during a week that I won’t be here (I’m going out of town for a wedding). So that also got my anxiety rolling. I’m laying in bed because I’m too anxious to get to class and I know if I miss today, I will have to drop the course. 

That is okay right? That’s a normal thing people do? I’m okay to be overwhelmed with school and work? I am going for my behavioral sciences degree and the BHS classes are a lot of reading, so alongside this class that isn’t a BHS class but does require me to do more added work I don’t see myself being able to handle the extra work.

I guess I’m just anxious because I feel ashamed for giving up and was hoping someone had a similar experience and could make me feel less shitty about the situation.

"I write to cope with my anxiety - Looking for feedback on a free-verse ""poem"" I wrote","Hi everyone, here is some background about me: 

 I have lived with pretty severe anxiety since I was very young. Outside of family, close friends, and significant others, I have never shared my experiences. 

This will be the first time I have shared anything like this with anyone. 

I write to cope with my anxiety. I couldn't tell you why, but it helps me to put what I'm feeling down on paper. Reading back my own thoughts and feelings just helps me understand them, and in turn, makes it a little easier to get through my day. 

Knowing the community here, I thought this would be the best place to share my personal expressions. So without further ado, here is a recent poem I wrote on an especially bad day. I would love to know any thoughts you all might have. 

Here we go...

&#x200B;

 

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be buried alive? 

This is how I imagine it

You wake up. At first, everything seems normal. Then, as your eyes begin to adjust to the little bit of light that exists in the hole that you are buried in, you begin to understand the gravity of your situation. 

You realize you only have a few inches of space on either side. You can’t really move, but you can move enough to convince yourself that you might get out of this. You can feel yourself, your surroundings, and the stale coldness that has become your blanket. 

You begin to talk yourself through your options. You could try to call for help. Do you have your phone? Do you even have service? What would be the point anyway? You don’t know where you are after all. You could be anywhere. Maybe there are people around. You start pounding and testing the strength of this box you’re in. Someone could hear you, but probably not. It’s not worth expending the energy to get help. You usually handle tough situations on your own, so what’s one more time? 

How can you survive this endeavor? How can you get out of this without help? 

Hope. Calm. Clarity. 

That’s what you need to hold on to. 

Hope, calm, and clarity.

But can you hold on? You have to try.

Just try. 

You feel around for anything that could improve your situation. You find that the screws keeping these walls around you can be loosened. It’s painstaking. It takes all your effort to just get one turn in right direction. But it’s something. Maybe there *is* hope. 

You persist. You put everything you have into loosening those screws. 

You get one out. 

Two out. 

Three. 

Four. 

You pop the lid open and light pours in. 

It feels like it’s been weeks since you’ve been in this box, but now…

You are going to survive. 

You burst out, gasping for fresh air, expecting there to be people all around you. They will congratulate you, cheer for you, and show their support for everything you have accomplished. 

But there is no one. 

No one knows you’re here. How could they? It’s not like you told anyone. You don’t even know how you got in this situation again…

Again? 

You remember now. 

You’ve been here before. You’ve gotten out before. But the last time… the last time there weren’t any screws. You had to kick and beat your way out. Last time was much harder, it took so much more to be free.

You had to break yourself before you could save yourself. That’s what it felt like. That’s what it feels like now. You’re just not as broken as before. 

Nevertheless, you must repair what you can.

You rebuild the parts of you that were broken. You rebuild the strength you had before this whole ordeal. You rebuild who you were, now that you are free to do so. 

For once, you are happy. You surround yourself with people who might have been there if you had called for their help. People who see you for who you are. Or rather, who you are presenting yourself to be… new, free, and ready for the future. 

You go to sleep at peace, knowing that you have survived another day. Or maybe it’s been weeks. It’s so easy to lose track when you are trapped inside of that box. 

But, the longer you are at peace, the stronger that feeling is inside of you. That feeling that something is wrong. That something MUST be wrong. 

Is it the past? Those thoughts that haunt you at night. The thoughts of being trapped inside that box. The thoughts of the people that should have been there.

Or maybe it’s the future? The impossible task of knowing what’s to come. The even more impossible task of knowing how you will react to it this time.

You can’t put your finger on it, and that feeling is debilitating. It starts to consume you from the inside out. That feeling that something might go wrong, that it *will* go wrong. Something always does. 

You start to protect yourself the only way you know how: you build your walls again. You put them up around you until there is only enough space for you. A few inches on each side. You don’t need light. You don’t need others. You just need you. You’ve fought off this feeling before. You can do it again…alone.

Hope turns to fear. Calm turns to panic. Clarity turns to obscurity. 

You wake up. At first everything seems normal. Then, as your eyes begin to adjust to the little bit of light that exists in the hole that you are buried in, you begin to understand the gravity of your situation… 

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be buried alive? 

Not under dirt. Not in a coffin. 

No. 

You are trapped in a box of your own making.

Buried alive under the weight of your own thoughts, your own imaginings, your own insecurities. 

Buried alive under the weight that something must be wrong…Because that’s the only way that life feels right. It is a weight that you can’t explain but one that envelopes you like a heavy blanket. It’s somehow warm, but chilling; comforting, but horrifying. You don’t want it to come back, but you know it will at some point. 

This weight. The weight you carry. 

That I carry. 

This…is the weight of anxiety.",1579802384.0,1.0,0
New source of anxiety,"So a few years ago, when I was in college, I had developed some anxiety. I was prescribed lexapro and used it for about a year until I finally got tired of it, it made me gain a lot of weight and made my depression worse. I had a few friends that suffered from anxiety and depression for a while and they were able to give me some tips to help me get through the last year of college unmedicated. 
Once I graduated I never really had an issue with my anxiety. A few anxiety attacks, but they were far in between and never really had a lingering anxiety, pretty manageable.
Now I’m starting to feel very anxious again and it almost never goes away. It started when my bf and I got in an argument and now that it’s resolved I’m still having really bad anxiety. I’ve had 3 random attacks at work in the past 2 days and I am constantly on edge. I can feel my heat racing, I’ve been shaking, and my appetite is gone. I wake up at least every hour at night but I’m always tired. I’ve tried going to gym and sweating it out, but it didn’t seem to help. 
I’m just wondering if you anyone has any advice for helping me ease my anxiety?

Anxious procrastination,"Preparing for an upcoming event seems like a reasonable thing to do when you have anxiety in order to reduce stress and negative anticipation, yet I often find myself unable to deal with something until the very last moment, thus greatly enhancing my anxiety. It's extremely difficult for me to complete unusual tasks on time.

I've been this way my whole life. It took me a while to realize that I don't procrastinate out of boredom or laziness, I do it out of stress/anxiety. In school, I avoided homework I knew I wouldn't understand because the thought of sitting in front of a sheet not understanding a word of it was terrifying. At work, I tend to avoid requesting time off or asking for things because confrontations are such a struggle to me, so I delay it until I can't anymore. My partner often gets mad at me for not doing certain things that have to do with finances because I'm anxious about spending money. If I'm not sure how to proceed with something, I'll procrastinate it because the thought of not understanding how it works stops me. I won't call places because phone calls are terrifying, especially if I can't predict how the interaction is gonna go. I won't go places if I'm unfamiliar with the location or if I've never been before and I'd have to be on my own.

It used to be so easy to brush this issue off as procrastination. I honestly would have preferred laziness over anxiety because the latter is just dreadful. 

I don't want to diagnose myself with anything, but I feel like I may have a generalized anxiety disorder. I'm supposed to get an official diagnosis soon, but in the meantime, do you ever experience this? Are you afraid to commit to new things because of the unknown or the unexpected? Any validation over how I feel about this would be appreciated.",1579793639.0,1.0,1

Guilty for leaving work early sick,"I left work today after being there for two hours because I was feeling semi-sick and wasn’t for sure if it was going to get progressively worse. For the past month I haven’t felt that great, usually a vicious cycle of allergies, depression and anxiety, fatigue. My supervisor, who is easy to talk to but still management, asked me what was going on, I haven’t had an accept attitude for a minute. I felt comfortable to be open and honest with him about how I was just having a hard time with life outside of work and I admittedly said that maybe some of the little things at work are kinda pushing me to my limits. He was very understanding and listened. I told him that I love my job and I would work better on my attitude, and i feel like I consciously have. That what about a week ago. 

Well today I woke up not feeling great. I was very congested but had all intentions of going to work and the thought of leaving early didn’t cross my mind. I don’t leave work early that often and I don’t have an issue with points on my attendance.  So after being at work, I was feeling kinda meh but still tried working on my attitude so I was joking around with the supervisor and whatnot. Then I started to feel more and more sick. My neck started to hurt and I got a bad headache, then within 30 min my stomach felt nauseous to the point I did go to the bathroom and puke. I decided then I should go home. We already had multiple call ins today and a mound of work that I could help my supervisor manage. So after joking around I am going up to him saying I need to go home. 

My anxiety is thru the roof as I sit on my couch because I feel really guilty for suddenly leaving work early.

My dog has been me this whole time.,"My family has a 4 year old lab. Though I don't live with them anymore, I still call him my dog. 

He has horrible anxiety. His biggest problem is that he absolutely refuses to walk on the hard floors. He used to hang out in the tiled kitchen and beg for food. Not anymore. He used to eat right by the front door where the floor is hard aside from a door mat. We had to move his bowl to the living room. I'll be playing catch with him and the ball would roll onto the hard floor, and he'd want me to go get it for him.  You could put a piece of bacon on the hard floor and he would just stand on the rug whining until he gave up. He has some kind of irrational fear that keeps him from doing things he loves. The couch and carpet are his comfort zone. I always thought he was crazy.

A couple Saturdays ago, I went to a bar to watch the NFL playoffs. I don't normally do this, but I was trying to break out of my shell. I've never approached a girl in public before, but maybe tonight's the night. After the first quarter, two girls walked in, and one of them was particularly cute. I started to think about approaching her, but I knew deep down that I would never do it. At halftime, the other girl's boyfriend walked in and quickly made the cute girl a third wheel. The couple was all lovey-dovey while the cute girl quietly sipped her drink. Alarm bells started going off in my head. I recognized that she was suddenly approachable. I knew in that moment that if I talked to her and got her number, I'd be the happiest guy in the world. I even knew that if I got rejected, I wouldn't care so much and would be happy that I tried. I knew that if I didn't take a chance, I'd regret it for a long time.

I didn't do it. I stayed on my comfortable barstool until the game ended, then went home to my comfortable apartment. I've regretted it ever since.

So anyway, does anyone know how to get this stupid dog to walk on the hard floor?",1579784832.0,0.79,0

Why do I feel anxious whilst playing ‘party’ video games with my partner?,"Don’t get me wrong, I love my zelda and several other solo games that I have on my switch. I even used to love playing overwatch before. 

Long story short, My partner loves his mario kart but I’ve hated my experience playing it with him. Recently we got another game called chicken horse which is quite similar and I noticed that it really messed me up. 

I felt like that competitive aspect of such ‘party’ games really raised my anxiety. I felt my heart rate rise and just genuinely feel physically uncomfortable. My partner was teasing me that I’m just grumpy (I also suck at those games, possibly just cause of my how I physically feel whilst playing). 

I like wholesome games, like when people work towards an object. One that helps one another to solve a puzzle. I just can’t seem to be playing games that requires you to sabotage others to victory. 

I’m just very curious as where this could be coming from? Could it be because of my anxiety or my very nature (I do find myself to be very much an introvert and a pacifist). 

Like I’ve seen my partner have such a good time playing these party games with his friends, why can’t I be like everyone else and enjoy a simple game without getting all worked up? 

Just curious to see if anyone else can relate to me.

Causes of anxiety,"1. I started going to a certain school where I was bullied a lot because I stood up for myself. Some guy illegally made a meme about me which was highly offensive but he was my bf at the time so I let it slide. My parents found out and got him suspended. 2 years later everyone at school still hates me because I defend my parents.

2. I don't have friends. I have a guy best friend who I like a lot but we'll probably get separated in the next 2 years when we go for different universities. I'll have no friends. He also likes me but he thinks we're going to get separated anyway so he has just stopped communicating much with me. I'm the one who texts usually.

3. My parents yell at me and threaten to hit me.

4. Everyone talks badly about me no matter how hard I try to improve on myself

5. I've started trying to read a book every week and stay positive and write positive things in my life but everything is still dull and sad. Is it because of me? Probably. But does that mean I don't try my best? NO.

6. I have exams and I love maths but I screwed up my maths exam and cried a lot. I wanted to take maths next year but now I just feel like I'm not good enough

7. I had a terrible panic attack yesterday

Anxiety disorder re-fueled by chances of pregnancy,"I was very drunk on new years and had unprotected sex with a woman. I was hesitant at first but she told me she was on the pill and I somehow believed it in my state, which is a stupid thing to do.

I accidentally, do the old compulsion and I feel worried because I cant confirm if the ""new thoughts without my will"" that relieved me, are 100% thoughts without my will. I worry because maybe I acted as if they maybe the matter and felt relieved.

When I am frustrated, I know that these ""new thoughts without my will"" will pop up and maybe it seems as if they are allowed to pop up, on purpose maybe. It is like trying to find an excuse in order to force myself not to do the tiring compulsion.

My Anxious Fears Are Being Confirmed,"I have been struggling with anxiety for many years. As I learned how to cope with anxiety in a more healthy way, I have begun to tell myself that all those anxious thoughts about ""I'm only a burden"" or ""does everyone hate me?"" is just me getting in my own head. But I feel like all those anxious fears are being confirmed before my eyes. 

It began when I was borrowing a friend's phone to look something up, and she received a text and my own name caught my eye. She had received a text from our mutual friend about me. What I saw were mean-spirited messages insulting everything from my taste in music, to how my voice sounds, to how annoying I was as I handled my recent breakup. I've never had an argument with either of these girls, we've gotten along well for several years and spent a lot of our free time together. I was devastated.

Then, a guy that I had been fwb asked if we could just remain friends. I was honestly fine with staying friends, I like him as a person but didn't see us being in a relationship. But then he cut me off completely. So it wasn't just the end of being attracted to me, it was like he had just been waiting to get rid of me.

Then, two months later, that same girl from before sent me screenshots from another person explaining why they didn't want me to be part of their group for an upcoming trip because I would annoy them and ruin their time. These are people who I would have considered my closest friends at uni. 

I have tried my best to be a good friend and not a burden, I really have. But it seems all my fears of being secretly hated and thought of as a nuisance are true. All of my anxious fears about being a burden to those around me are true. From snide comments to seeing messages not meant for my eyes, it becomes clearer every day that people don't really like me, they hang out with me more out of obligation than anything else and are ready to drop me at any moment.",1579774221.0,1.0,2

Can you please calm me down?," The last 3 months, I am having thoughts without my will about promises to an other God. These thoughts without my will create compulsions.

 I, accidentally, do the compulsion and I am very worried because I cant confirm if the new thoughts without my will were 100% without my will because they relieved me and maybe i acted as if they maybe matter in order to trick ocd. I always fall in the same trap when I try to trick ocd. 

 I have reminded myself many times, if a compulsion is created, not try again to trick ocd. I should not have new thoughts without my will that will relieve me. I do not know why but I always fall on the same trap. it is like as if, maybe, I forgot about the traps and the worries I may have and I maybe make the mistake to have new thoughts without my will.

  I do not want to make promises. I overpray to an other God and I try not even think the word promise but I end up worried. I asked from an other God to protect me from these thoughts and never accept promises.

I end up, having these scary new thoughts wihout my will and feeling free cause I am forced not to do the compulsion. I end up accidentally doing the compulsion. 

 I overpray in order to tell an other God stuff like that I am not making promised and that ocd always tries to trap me. I have prayed about it a lot. I have asked for protection. why, while I try not even think the word promise, I end up worrying that maybe I made one, accidentally, due to frustration?

Boxed In,"Where to start? 

Looking back, I’ve had issues with depression and anxiety all my life. Neither became serious or intense enough for me to seek help until about ten years ago (I’m in my early 40s). 

Of course, since being diagnosed, I’ve been through the gauntlet of meds and combinations there of. I imagine it’s the same for many people but, for me, they seem to help maybe 10 or 20 percent of the time but that’s about it. 

I’ve been married for a long time and, while we’ve had ups and downs, things have generally been pretty good up until this past year. The digs and jabs at each other just started to get progressively worse along with a steady increase to just fighting in general and....you get the idea. Our fights have never involved violence of any kind until a few weeks ago. It was a bad one and we were both yelling a lot. My wife gets very malicious and cruel when she’s angry. She knows just where the separations are in my “armor” and has no issue with exploiting those
vulnerabilities. She began doing so during this fight a few weeks back and really hit a nerve that caused me to start to cry. I was reduced to the point of sobbing and I asked her for us to just call a halt to the hostilities and talk. I reached out to attempt hugging her and she hit me. Hard. She didn’t hurt me and it hasn’t happened since but she was clearly putting everything she had behind that swat and I never, in a million years, expected it. She never apologized but she hasn’t done it since. 

I’ve been here for a few years and met someone I thought was a kindred spirit in a sub a couple of weeks ago. I should have known better, but we became very close very fast and it felt great to have someone just to talk to that actually made me smile and feel good about myself. After about a week and a half, that all came to a screeching halt. Ghosted. Ghosted, but this is Reddit, so I got to still watch her flirt with and hit on other me.  Lesson learned. It was something that I shouldn’t have been doing in the first place so I brought 100% of that hurt upon myself. Fuck, though, did it (and does it) hurt. 

While there’s been no more boxing, the fighting just continues to intensify at home. Something that is new, though, is that she’s started using my mental health struggles as ammo against me and holding them over my head during our arguments. 

This week, after 20 years of busting my ass for the same company and working my way into a great, extremely well-paying job that I earned and loved, I was downsized. More fuel for the argument fires. 

I can’t. I just can’t. I want to sleep. I want to hide. I want to run away. I want to do whatever I need to do for this feeling to stop. After forty odd years of life, it’s just shown me very quickly and in painful detail, how fucking disposable I am. Ok, universe. Point taken. Now what?

If I pull the rip cord on life, it will destroy my family and the thought of doing that to them makes me sick(er) inside. On the flip side, I can’t face the thought of waking up tomorrow (and the day after that, the day after that, etc.) next to someone who is clearly done with me and will likely remind me of how useless I am before lunch time. 

For those of you that read through all of my drivel, thank you so much. I have no idea what I’m going to do but I know I don’t want to do it. I just needed to get this off of my chest.

2020 not going good so far.,"It's only January of 2020 and I am stressin. big time. 

 Just a couple days ago my boyfriend and I decided to adopt a puppy together and im starting to feel adopters remorse/guilt/stress/anxiety. The night before I got cold feet thinking about adopting our pup, but carried on with it because I knew my boyfriend wanted a dog really bad. Now that we have her, I'm so in love with her and I really don't want to ever give her up. but im starting to feel so anxious and stressed. im scared to let her out of my sight bc I don't want her to pee or poop around the house and me not catch her. I can barely sleep bc all I can think about is her whining or barking in the middle of the night and maybe I won't hear her or the fact that I'll be woken from my sleep(I have a lot of sleeping issues). the past few days have been revolved around her, I give her all my attention but in return i'm neglecting my college work or my personal time. my boyfriend is at such ease with her and has no issues. I want to find a balance but all I feel like I can do is panic. 

On top of that, im writing this post on my laptop at almost 2am because I tried to update my iPhone 6 Plus(actually my dads old one) and it activation locked me out. The email the iPhone is tied to is my dads. I accidentally did this same thing last year with my other iPhone 6 Plus hence why I am using my dads. (long story). I have to be at work at 8am and since my alarm clock is on the phone that I locked I don't know what im going to do. Also since my phone is jank, I had to restore it to update or to even use it so all my photos and notes and text messages are erased. 

This all might seem super small but I can't help it. If we are being honest I cried before writing this. Also this Chinese New Year is the year of the rat which is me. So supposedly I'm suppose to have bad luck this year and everyone around me will have good luck. no pressure at all. im tired. im stressed. I just want to cry and sleep.",1579766364.0,0.95,4

Can’t sleep. Feel like everyone hates me,"Having a moment right now and not sure what else to do but ramble.

Cringing at a weird moment at work and now it’s spiraling.

Idk if anyone else does this but I have jerky movements and will say disturbing things to myself without even realizing and it takes for my husband to say “you okay?” 3 times to snap me back to reality.

He’s the best. I honestly feel like my anxiety isn’t fair to him. It ruins our night like once a week. I mean I’m not mean or anything but it’s probably not fun having to console a jerky babbling weirdo when you’d rather hangout and take a break from a stressful day at work.

Uncertain future makes me not want to even try.,"I’m a 27yr old male, I have a family (wife and daughter), my own apartment and my own car. Ever since I can remember I thought I would grow up to have this amazing future. Im currently a truck driver so I make a decent living but ever since my depression/anxiety/pure-o hit 2 years ago due to economic issues, it’s hard to see a future for myself. I have this immense fear of going insane or that I will just give up later on down the line and take my own life. I’ve gotten back on my feet since my hard times 2 years ago but a part of me wants to do better. I don’t want to be a truck driver forever. I have a vision of me going back to school to get my real estate license and living a fulfilling life but every time I start to look into taking the next step I always seem to bring myself down. I tell my self what’s the point if I might end up going crazy or doing something I can never take back. It makes me want to quit before I even start. I’ve tried taking antidepressants for a week but it made me have so much energy it just felt unnatural. I honestly believe the pure-ocd has a big part to play in it. I have these fears of schizophrenia and suicide that I just can’t seem to shake. I used to open up a lot about my issues but after 2yrs of saying the same old tale I tend to just keep it in now. It’s funny... I used to be “that guy” who thought mental illness is something you can just get over and now it’s whipping my ass lol. If anyone experienced this I would love to hear your take on it.",1579764584.0,0.83,1
I’ve been off SSRIs for a few weeks and my anxiety is terrible. But I love talking to people again?,"I’ve been taking 10 mg of Lexapro for a couple of years now. I ran out of my prescription a few weeks ago but I was travelling and couldn’t refill.

My mood is all over the place, my paranoia is back, and my anxiety is through the roof. Normal stuff. But I noticed that right now I’m really open to talk and catch up with people around me, and make small talk. I even enjoy it. I would avoid conversations with acquaintances when I was on Lexapro. I really hated it. I chalked it up to being very socially anxious. I would avoid eye contact as much as possible to duck out of social interactions, and I needed to psych myself up if I was going to be social. 

The downside now is that while I’m enjoying my conversations and happy to keep them going, I’m over-analyzing the crap out of my interactions after and wracking up paranoia over every little thing. Oh well! At least having a conversation isn’t as torturous as before. 

I want to keep this extroverted part of myself, the part that doesn’t run into walls to avoid conversations. I feel like I found a part of myself from long ago. 

Has anyone noticed this about being on SSRIs? I know I need to get back on them to get a hold on other symptoms. I’d love to find a way to maintain my new social behaviour.

EDIT: I am actually prescribed 20 mg. 20 mg is definitely the perfect dosage for my anxiety and wipes it almost completely, but I take 10 mg because I find it’s still manageable with a lower dosage. I had some worries about increasing a tolerance to SSRIs and wanting to take the minimum possible.",1579763409.0,1.0,2
Remind me it’s going to be okay,"(Health anxiety - warning) The world is terrifying lately. I know the media blows things out of proportion - but I’ve been suffering from the worst anxiety since the beginning of flu season - yesterday I got a flu shot and now I’m convinced that’s going to harm me in some way (I know it’s not, rationally.) now, the Wuhan virus has me so terrified (I live in Los Angeles, so I don’t even have the right to be afraid yet). I can hardly stand being around other people for fear of catching something. I think the ultimate fear for me is death, of course, but I hate flu season so much. It feels so out of control.

Im dreading getting a job soon,"Im looking forward to getting a part time job for the money and the social benefits. But im dreading getting it also because of my loss of freedom and knowing that if I take a day off to make myself feel better or take off Christmas or go to my piano lessons  I'll get fired. Im trying to have a mentality of there are plenty of other jobs in my town if anything goes wrong. Im not wanting to become a wage slave and work a deadend job until I realize it's too late. 

I have no clue how to make myself feel better about this my father is mostly pushing me to get one and my mother doesn't care. I can't keep living off of what's left of my money and just be miserable because I can't afford to pay for anything fun. 

What's getting me the most is just knowing that all of my activities I love doing are going to have to stop and I have no control over it. I won't be able to read as much or drive around and just wonder my town or play my video games or just spend time with my family.

I know this is the first step into adulthood and Im really not looking forward to the side effects of it.",1579762097.0,1.0,0
These past 2 weeks my anxiety has been off the charts until i wake up too early to until I go to sleep too late,"It’s such an awful feeling. And I know why it’s because a lot of changes have suddenly happened so well my parents have been divorced since I was little and now I switched parents for a semester so I’m at a new school, in a new house with different people. I’m constantly overthinking everything. I can’t even function I cry every night. I freak out constantly and fidget too much. But also I’m highly aware of everything that I’m doing at the same time as I’m zoning out constantly to think about stuff. I spent 45 minutes zoned out in deep thought in math class today while drawing a lemon dude twirling around throwing glitter. Then snapped out of it when the teacher came around and looked at my page looking confused. I then preceded to do 10 big math problem all completely in head at sonic speed skipping all the steps to only putting down the answer (great it’s probably gonna look like a copier someone else) I’m constantly scared that everyone is judging me and hates me, that my family doesn’t want me here, if I fail I’m going to get sent back, that I’m ugly, I’m stupid, that I’m fat, that I’m going to fail all my classes, being not sure if I should have came here or not, sorting out the pros and cons of killing myself, thinking about how maybe my grandma is watching me from heaven and is maybe incredibly disappointed in me. That I’m no ones #1. That I sound stupid. That I’m unlovable. That I’m too different. That me being here alive is a mistake. That if I killed myself it would maybe leave some people sad which would then cause them to do a bunch of stupid things. That I’m a terrible person.  Just a zillion things. That why do people keep lying to me. When 10 years go by of family and people telling you that you just haven’t found your group yet or the right people yet you begin to think that maybe you are meant to be alone. To live a lonely and sad life and to die alone. As maybe I don’t want that I’ve tried but i don’t want to keep trying because it hurts to much. I’m overthinking everything but I just can’t stop and it’s going to drive me to end it all.",1579760832.0,1.0,1

"Rushing around all frantic-like, like I have to do it ALL today","I tend to drive in circles in this small rural college town.  Or, I drive fast on country roads.   I do to see things, calm down/decompress for the drive itself, and its give myself something to do.  It also gives me time alone to think, which is usual for I am usually alone and thinking

It is cheaper than therapy, but I don't know if as effective.  It is cool to see things like today two moose thru the trees.

The only thing is today it got me in trouble.  I got stuck in 3 ft snow and had to walk a mile before helped me get home.  My car is still stuck up on Forest Service land, but tomorrow a professional will tow it.

I also have been catching myself rushing into the dollar store to grab things like it has be done so fast, though I have no plans afterwards.  Why all this rushing around, is it hyper-vigilance, part of American culture, or just part of who I am?

DPDR and GAD,"Hi. I was diagnosed with GAD when I was younger, and in late November I had a huge panic attack for the first time due to accidentally having an edible and have had persistent DPDR since.

At first, I had no idea what it was and thought I was going mad. I then learnt what it was, but none of the advice was helping me. For example, that bull crap: “just don’t be anxious! Hehe!”. Since I also have mild-mod OCD, the intrusive thoughts would and will not go away. Though I’m learning to deal with them, I still have dissociative episodes.

I was put onto sertraline 50mg, and after 4 weeks I just felt the same - and so ive been on lexapro 10mg for 2 weeks today 

A few days ago, I noticed that I wasn’t feeling anxious - my appetite and sleep have come back, and I have had days which passed without the physical anxiety - a tight chest, sore stomach, and fast heartbeat. But today, I woke up feeling good yet went back to sleep and have felt dissociated all day.

I am very discouraged because I was feeling better and was hopeful, but today I just feel bad again and am so anxious that it won’t actually get better or I’ll be put in a psych ward or develop a worse disorder where I am just numbed by medication.

I hate this. And I just don’t know what to do, has this type of experience happened to anyone else? Will it get okay again? Why do I feel like this. Was the good feeling just due to me getting out of the house? Ahhhhhh (please don’t respond if all you have to say is: “just stop thinking about it” because it’s the physical feeling for me and the intrusive thoughts)",1579759952.0,1.0,0
I can't eat food in front of guys I like. Is this a form of anxiety?,"It started with my ex a few years ago. Our very first date, there was a lot of buildup. I find it attractive when a guy is comfortable eating a lot in front of me, idk it's masculine to me. So I met this powerlifter guy on Tinder and we said we would have a wing-eating contest for our first date to determine who gets to be big spoon (we're both guys). It was adorable lol but once I got my food, I felt instantly nauseated and eventually vomited in the restroom. It happened throughout the entire relationship and even now, years later, where if I even think about a guy I'm romantically or sexually interested in, my stomach hurts and I have to keel over a toilet. 

I've been told it was an issue with my stomach acid by one doctor but if so, why does it happen only in this circumstance? It's driving me insane because I can't even enjoy a first date with guys anymore.",1579759664.0,0.78,3

Skin picking may risk my life and I’m still doing it.,"I don’t want advice about how to quit picking. 

I’ve always picked the skin around my fingers as I’m sure a lot of you on here do, I also pick any type of scab on my body. Just the feeling of uneven texture over my skin and the need to get something out. Well I had surgery just over a week ago, and despite the fact that my incisions literally lead to the inside of my body and the healing of these wounds is crucial and an infection could be life threatening, guess who’s dumb ass still feels the need to pick them. So far I’ve picked the glue off of all of them, there’s 4. 2/4 were lucky enough to be mostly healed by the time my grimy fingers peeled them free, but the other two are having a hard time. They are both gaping enough to wear I can see my fat and despite having a panic attack about it earlier today, I’m still picking them. I just now picked one so much that I’ve exposed the internal stitches so I’ve just had another panic attack. My mom tells my I’ll be fine and I just have to let them heal, but how when I can’t keep my hands off them? I feel so stupid because picking the skin around my fingers or a scab off my face is so trivial, means nothing. But here I am, with cuts that are detrimental to my health, and for some reason my brain thinks the same principal applies. 

It’s such an odd feeling because I get anxious about the uneven texture and pick it, then it gets worse and I get anxious about getting an infection, and my anxiety makes me want to pick more. I feel so disgusted with both my body and my mind, I feel gross that there is literally holes in my body with scabby bits and stitches poking out and I can’t do anything about it. I feel horrible that in a situation wear picking is *seriously* not the best idea, I still can’t not do it. This is how my brain sounds “ew that lumpy bit is poking out you should peel it off, oh now look what you’ve done you’re gonna get infected and die now, pick more to stop thinking about it.” I don’t know what I’ll do if I ever have to have a another procedure in the future. This is the most anxiety ridden I’ve been in a long time and I seriously just can’t wait for these stupid things to heal and me to be done with it.",1579756360.0,1.0,1
Freaking out about my cat,"So about an hour ago I noticed my beloved cat's (Vinney)  eye had turned red and he was shutting that eye. 

Now I love this cat so much, he has helped me through the hardest times in my life. He is 16 years old, so a lot could be going wrong and I am terrified. I just never want him to be in pain. He is still eating and drinking though. I am just freaking out. I have had a string of bad days in my relationship and the idea alone of my cat dying or anything is sending me over the edge. 

I have texted my boyfriend saying I am freaking out, but I haven't gotten much help. The same ""you are worrying too much"" that I got from my mom. I know I am worrying, and probably am too much. But I really don't like how dismissive that statement is. I also know he is hanging out with a friend right now, but would it be so much to ask for that he call me or something. He knows this cat means the world to me. 

I love my boyfriend I truly do, I am just so overwhelmed. 

I have my cat on my bed rn, and he is kinda grouchy but still doesn't seem to be in pain. I am just giving him lots of pets and attention.

Trouble staying asleep/night terrors,"I (28F) have been on Zoloft for anxiety for 10 years this spring. I have also been prescribed Xanax, to take when I feel a panic attack is coming. These medications had been working fine for me. Unfortunately, I am beginning to wonder if something changed in the past year.

Last winter, I started to experience stomach problems after my mother was dealing with her own mental health issues. I went to the doctor and had some tests done, which all came back fine. My stomach issues subsided. Since then, those stomach problems have come back occasionally, usually when I’m under stress. 

Within the past three months, I have experienced difficulties staying asleep and I have been having night terrors. While I have always had a sensitive stomach, these sleeping problems are entirely new. As I was taking a nap today, I kept waking up because I knew I was dreaming. It was the strangest experience — I felt like I was nervous about getting trapped in a dream. I also believed I experienced a bit of sleep paralysis a few weeks ago. I was lying in bed and couldn’t move. I was terrified.

I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced the problems I have faced. If so, what have you done? I have an appointment scheduled with my primary doctor in early March. Should I ask about switching medication? I have gone to therapy, but, unfortunately, my new insurance does not cover it (don’t get me started on that topic).",1579753760.0,1.0,0

Do you get anxious of driving cause other people are looking at you?

I skip some days because as the title says. I practice in my tiny neighbourhood area, like in a not so perfect oval shaped road ways, so theres straight road plus a couple of turns.

I feel some days im okay like when i hit the break and gas pedal, its all smooth then some days im just horrible, like the car is not cruising smoothly. Like today, i told my self i will practice at least 30 minutes but cut it to 15 min cause there were ppl outside.... and i felt i was driving horribly. 

When i got my license ( or the day I sat for my test), i was comfortable driving. In the beginning of my classes i was not but eventually i was. I even passed the test on the first try. But then i had a gap of 4-5 ish months of not driving due to not having a car. But then i got it like in nov i think and its back to square one. And its extra hard without a instructor by my side and i feel less confident.

Tomorrow she is coming to visit me for the weekend as she doesn’t have class Friday and she finishes in the middle of the afternoon. Her original plan was to come right away after class, but I asked her if she could maybe come and hour or so later than she planned so I could finish off some of my work. I could tell that didn’t sit well with her as I could notice over the phone that her anxiety was starting to spike a bit. I asked her why she was feeling this way, and she said she had everything planned out, and pushing her visit an hour back threw her schedule all off.

She was getting very anxious and being 2 hours away from her, I felt useless over the phone and she promptly ended the call. I’ve only recently started to understand the extent of her anxiety issues as she had a bit of an anxiety attack last night. 

I don’t know how to help her and I genuinely don’t understand what to do. I want nothing more than to help her but I’m new to this and don’t really understand how to handle it. To me it doesn’t seem like a big deal because it’s just an hour we lose over the next 4 days, but for some reason this has kinda broken her. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do to help alleviate her anxiety?",1579751773.0,1.0,2
A little hopeful. I might have found a way out.,"For context, I'm 21 and sadly can't afford to live on my own so I've been stuck with my parents for awhile now. They're not very supportive of my anxiety, depression, etc. even when I told them I was having very dark thoughts of harming myself or worse. My anxiety has been spiking to an all time high recently, and I honestly hate waking up in the morning because I know it's just another day of being in a house with people that don't genuinely care about me. Last night, I managed to go out for a drink with my best friend, who knows my situation. He's offered me a place to stay at his house to get me out of my parents' place and help me get my life together a bit more. He's not sure when it'll happen, as his dad has been having health issues and is staying with him because of it, but he says he'll do his best to get me there as soon as possible. This is just so great for me because at least I'll be able to wake up in the morning knowing that if I'm not in a good mood, I'll have someone there to motivate me, someone who I'm at least excited to see, and someone who actually cares about me. This is just a huge step forward for me, and I'm hoping it'll lead to further progress and healing.",1579751686.0,1.0,0

Anxiety and bulimia?,"I’ve always been extremely anxious, mostly socially, and I also have an issue with drinking alcohol to alleviate social stress. Anxiety makes my head feel so tense and foggy, and after I vomit I feel a kind of temporary release and relaxation that I never do otherwise. I think it’s the stress on my body, which afterwards just needs to take a break. Has anyone else experienced this and found a way to stop it? My weight is fine, I don’t exercise much but I know I’m not throwing up to lose weight, it’s really more about the temporary head relief.

Does anyone here use weighted blankets?,"Hi guys. Let me start off by saying that i don't have anxiety, but my friend does. She has a birthday coming up, and i was thinking it would be cool/thoughtful to surprise her with a weighted blanket. If possible, i would love to hear from people with mild-severe anxiety on how your weighted blankets are helping you. If i had to guess, id say my friend is on the mild side. She just started taking meds for it, and ive really only seen her have an attack 2-3 times. Is getting the blanket worth it?

I'm waiting to see if I got a job or not,"Title says it all. I applied for a job at a local children's museum and I had my I interview yesterday. Ever since then I have been panicking, just worried sick about how I did. I am currently in an alternate school program due to my anxiety and I need to have a job in order to stay in it. My current job at a fast food place just drives me insane. I'll spend days worrying about even tiny shifts, and during those shifts I get so overwhelmed when we're busy. And I absolutely hate working drive thru because along with the overwhelming aspects there are so many smokers and I hate serving them when they can't put down their cancer sticks so that I don't have to poison myself. My parents want me to wait to see if I got the new job before I turn in my 2 weeks but I can't stand the thought of working there any longer than I need to.


I feel like I did well in my interview. I've worked with kids numerous times in the past and I think I answered every question the best that I could, but I've been over-analyzing everything I said just wondering ""oh If I said something different I would've gotten the job"" even though I have no idea if I got it or not. My plan is to wait 1 week and if I haven't heard back to call, but I've been worrying myself so much in just 1 day I don't know how I can wait that long.

Please help me 😔,"I was popping off in Sophomore Year then I picked some classes to fulfill an advanced diploma. Then I went to South America and did some sh*t intern job at a graphic design company. I was depressed then I took a vacation on a vacation and met some cousins I had never met before. We did alcohol and shit but then on the second night I did acid. Man life hasn’t been the same since, I had felt such a strong sense of absolute FREEDOM and when the high ended I passed out in the car returning to the city I was staying before the mini vacation. Everything since was a blur. Days and weeks gone and still go by! I realized how pathetic my life is! My parents limit me! I want to make music and play games and be myself but I can’t! I get home and I have time for nothing! Do this and do that! I was bullied freshman year in high school and I had forgotten everything about it, then a month after the high the memories came back. I can’t go anywhere without familiar faces because I feel anxiety and my neck spasms and I can’t move or speak! I’m failing the classes I picked last year in high school and the school won’t help me!!! I even tried to make the depression go away by talking to this girl I knew from the previous year, but that drove me really down. I didn’t know about this other kid she liked, so I guess out of a state of despair I told her I liked her, I walked home in a terrible state and she called me and I said some things. The kid hates me for making her cry, fuck him! she was a person I talked to regularly and he was there and fucked it all up. Whatever I don’t care anymore but everytime I seen them walk around the school I get disgusted! It made me stop trying any relationships. I am currently in a state of despair, and I’m not sure where I’m going and where the journey will be. I don’t want to be poor and homeless, I don’t want to be seen as a mentally ill person. I take some of lithium orotate that my mom bought for my dad in secret and my god, it’s the only damn thing that helps with the spasms in my neck and the anxiety in general. I have trouble sleeping and I don’t think I can take more of this any longer.

Irrational fear I’m going to run into my ex or her roommate,"
I prepare for conversations. It’s an anxiety thing because I have slow processing speed but have an otherwise normal or speedy brain. Also, I don’t want to sound stupid. I went No contact with my ex without informing her in advance a few days after the break up. 

My ex and I used to talk multiple times a day. When I was bored I’d call, when she was board she’d call. We had a routine. Probably one of the factors that led to the break up to be fair. 

So now, when I go anywhere, I’ve started to prepare as if my ex and I were going to run into each and what I would say. I’ve started to project as if I ran into her roommate as well. I’ve caught on to it. I know it’s because of the increased dopamine hit when we would talk and I’m likely going through withdraw. I understand that this is normalish. I’m still worried.

I've been married for nearly 2 years now and I've had issues with my husband pretty much from the beginning of our marriage.

He fails to understand the severity of the situation and the fact that HE has caused my depressive episode.

Need darkness to see the light.,"I’ve come to a real conclusion that I have a very strong ability to manipulate my body.  Past muscles.  The ability to overcharge the heart, tighten the spine, to build a reality based on feeling.  I’m a hyper-responder.  

And I think hyper-responders need to be bombarded with challenges, to move on from the pathology of using the body to hurt the mind.  To realize the mind is stronger than what the body is telling it.  

For me, it was making sure I would eat donuts, instead of having an utterly perfect diet full of possible allergens.  Except those allergens, for me, were in my head.  I never had full blown allergies once I tested them in times where my mind did not care what happened to the body.  To essentially poison yourself, so you don’t have such strong reactions to feeling bad.  To feel bad, so you’re reminded what feeling good is, and to be confronted.

I needed to get my first panic attack in my mid 20s to learn about the spectrum of where the mind can go.  It still affects me to this day, and ultimately I’m glad it happened.  I learned that everything was always in my head.  My happiness, sadness, intrusive thoughts.

I had to organize, and it’s still a challenge, but the outcome has made me a stronger adult.

I don't know if it's because I'm on so many other medications due to other health issues that she seems hesitant to prescribe something?

Intense shame and anxiety around sex,"Since I was really little, sex has been an off the table subject with my family.   I never got ""the talk"".  I learned about sex from friends and pornography.

It wasnt  constant, it lasted for 2 or 3 days, maybe a total of 10 times. Since it happened i've started to feel constantly anxious and i'm also having several panic attacks every day and night.

Struggling to succeed in interviews. Really having a tough time. What do you all suggest?,"Hi /anxiety,

So I graduated college in 2019 and since then I have struggled and struggled with interviews...and well, to get a job somewhat related to what I studied. I currently work at my old part-time job, but right now I am having a tough time powering through job interviews. After reflecting on this situation, I have realized a few things.. --

1. Really, I think my biggest issue is that if I am asked an unfamiliar question, I will basically choke on words and force a sentence out, sometimes painfully (excessive stammering, uncontrollable mouth movement, etc). This never happens with general questions such as ""What is your greatest strength and weakness, why do you want to work here, etc"" because I've practiced those so much. This tends to happen when answering situational/behavioral questions, because half the time I literally can't think of a situation related to that question. I find it brutally difficult to actually come up with a coherent response and when I finally answer the question, it will sound like word vomit and overall lukewarm. So in all reality, if I don't strictly memorize that question, I will not be able to smoothly answer it. What generally happens is that I'll say ""That's a great question, do you mind if I take a minute?"", and then proceed to frantically search for something decent to say, on top of dealing with extremely long and uncomfortable long pauses.
2. I try my hardest to ""loosen up"" during the interview, but I just...can't. It's never the employers fault, because they always make me feel relaxed and at ease. The thought of just sitting in the conference room (or wherever the interview is conducted) just sends me into a state of panic. I'm an excessive coffee drinker (5+ cups a day, strong black coffee) so before the interview I instead had a piping hot cup of green tea to mitigate my nerves. Sadly, that did not help and I found myself mentally exhausted by the time the interview was over with. I drink coffee because it generally perks me up and helps with my mood. 

&#x200B;

I just had another interview today, and it did not go well. Or maybe it did and I'm being too hard on myself. But of course, I have had numerous people on this site tell me that ""I had a terrible interview but I actually ended up getting the job."" That's somewhat reassuring, but I can't help but feel inadequate after I finish an interview. Perhaps this is caused by being somewhat ""sheltered"" as a kid growing up and never pushing myself to face my fears, also probably because all throughout my college career I literally never did any interview prep or resume prep, I just focused intensely on my schoolwork and worked at my part-time job to pay the bills.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I really feel like I'll never improve. I mean, I probably gave 40 presentations/speeches all throughout high school and college, yet I never improved on any of them, even after practicing many nights before. I suppose I'll just need to practice more and get familiar with some of these interview questions, because I don't really feel like i'm in a good place right now.",1579731449.0,0.76,3
How do I stop the skin picking?,"So for all of my life, I have bit my nails and picked my skin as I'm sure many of you do. My therapist says it's definitely an effect of my anxiety. I got acrylics for a semester of college and that really helped to curb it. Despite the price it was worth it. Obviously I still bit/picked at it but the pain was less. Now, however, I'm studying abroad in a country where I don't speak the language. I feel anxious just thinking about going to a nail salon with how bad the picking has gotten. At this point, it honestly feels like self-harm. I'm bleeding all the time. I brought so many pretty rings to wear and now I feel like I never want to draw attention to my fingers.

Right now I've resorted to putting band-aids on the fingers that look the worst but it just draws more attention I feel like. No matter what I can't stop picking or biting, and I feel like I've tried everything. Wearing a scrunchie to pick at instead, putting my hands away from each other, etc. Now it just feels like I do it for the pain.

I'm 19 and just want this to stop. I know it isn't good for me or my health but it's so innate. So for anyone that has seriously picked/bit at their nails/skin, please...what helped you finally end it or make it better? I'm desperate.",1579731445.0,1.0,2
Anti anxiety meds,"I've tried pretty much every SSRI in the book to no avail to cope with my depression/anxiety. Recently my anxietys become unmanageable, and I just wanna get it under control I can cope with the depression.

The only SNRI I tried briefly years ago I remember seemed to help me a bit was Venlaflaxine, I just got prescribed pregabalin for anxiety which made me feel really really bad (couldn't remember the day of the week it was) although it did calm my panic attacks down within 2 days.

My GP will no longer prescribe me benzos, which were the only thing that ever actually made me feel relaxed. I'm  now so anxious I haven't slept properly in weeks which is making it all 10x worse.

Anyway. I just wondered if anyone had any good experiences with medications that helped them with crippling anxiety/panic attacks other than benzos so I can approach my GP about trying them. I can't carry on like this it's ruining my life and I feel dizzy, tired, depersonalised and ike I'm losing my mind almost 24/7.

My parents anxieties are making me feel trapped,"I'm 25 and I've been sobbing for over an hour because one specific episode made me realize I won't be able to do a lot of things in my life cause my parents (especially my mother) won't allow discussion.

I never actually hear a scream, but it feels like one, if you get what I mean. It usually creeps up when I'm anxious (Haha a lot of the time), working, or neutral, never when I'm in a good mood. 

When I do get the scream feeling, reality seems a tad warped for a second, as my brain tries to understand why I'm feeling/hearing(?) that right now. 

It's a lot milder than what my anxiety usually brings, but it is kind of a weird symptom. I'm wondering if anyone else has the same experience or any understanding of what might be going on.

CBD,"I’ve heard a ton of people say CBD helps their anxiety a lot, so I’m about to give it a try!

How to politely avoid someone who follows me around at the gym.,"Hi guys.

I have been attending a gym for 2 years and I am an introverted socially awkward young male. I enjoy gym to release stress and get stronger but I also consider it a private time where I prefer not to speak and I can reflect upon my day as I work hard.

Recently, a young man has started following me around at the gym. He's a pretty large dude and I suspect that he might suffer some form of mental illness as he acts.. strange. For example, his gruntings are excessive and he makes comments about other women very loudly. He also does inappropriate things like pulling his clothes aside to show off his muscles and stuff. Not particularly someone an introvert wants to be around. However he follows me, like to every machine.

He tries to recommend work outs and pull me into his routine but I just want to do my own thing. I don't have the heart to shut him down as he seems like a nice guy, just not.. all there in the mind. Anyway last night at the gym I walked in and literally within 1 min I hear ""BRO"" and he comes up and starts chatting while I'm on treadmill, he then followed me for my entire work out.

I've got a few options here it seems.

Be rude and act disinterested and hopefully he'll move on.

Move gyms - lol

Tell him to ""Frigg off pls"" (Easier said than done man!)

Can you guys offer any legit advice for this? I realise this is probably easy shit for most people but dammit man I have anxiety lol. I don't want to be mean as he doesn't seem to be a bad guy. I just don't want to talk to people or draw attention to myself.",1579726769.0,0.75,2
How do I deal with the psychological weight of being alive? and more...,"Alright so basically, I (16M) was diagnosed with anxiety earlier last year, the anxiety has come  itself from a few different things. It started with specific triggers (car accident, multiple public vomiting incidents) to ongoing general things (my parents broken marriage, shame of my identity, my relationship with my father), and now the most recent and most suffocating reason: I constantly feel like I am responsible for the salvation of everyone I love, and this is creating a huge weight on my shoulders. I am posting this to a few communities because I think different perspectives would help.  
To explain, I am christian, but growing up in this day and age, I think it’s harder than ever to live a virtuous and christ-like life. Specifically with sex. I have decided that I will not be having sex until I am married, but that decision has led me to think it’s my responsibility to make sure those I live and share my faith with do the same. I have been talking to friends about it, warning them, telling them. And I feel this has more to do with myself and a psychologically issue than it is with me wanting what’s best for others. It has been an obsessive thought. And don’t get me wrong, I am not nowhere near perfect. I have dealt with porn addiction and other things, but I am trying. And I feel like I am setting standards for others that I myself am not able to achieve. I’d appreciate it if someone can help me understand the basis of this problem. Why is my anxiety manifesting itself in this way? Why am I finding this hard, this psychological weight of being alive? Why do I feel like it’s my responsibility to make sure others are pure and don’t sin? I’d appreciate any perspective on this.  And if there is anything I can clarify, please let me know through a comment or message. Thanks. God bless.",1579726516.0,1.0,1

Did I have a panic attack? (ER story),"I want to preface this that I have been diagnosed with anxiety but its ""mostly"" under control as I currently do not take usual anti anxiety meds, just a few for sleeping, trazadone, hydroxizine, CBD oil, though the one that feels does the most is CBD.  

I also have been having breathing problems for the last year.  So far it's been mostly allergy related, I'm on a 1 a day control inhaler.  Even though later on my actual Asthma test came up negative, I still take the control because it does seem to help, cold air, dust, are triggers.  

So when I woke up today with shortness of breath, dizzy, felt like passing out, I thought it was lung related.  My inhalers did nothing, I felt awful, so I had my wife drive me to the ER.  

Blood tests came back normal.  Had a chest CT scan which showed no abnormalities.  My blood is circulating oxygen fine, my lungs are not wheezy.  So they basically sent me home and said to follow up with my primary.  

I'm still tired, and little nauseous.  But I'm doing slightly better later in the day.  Is this all in my head?  I've had smaller attacks before but they felt way different, and once I realised I was anxious it went away. They were never debilitating as it was today.",1579724428.0,0.5,10
Bailed out,"My friend: R, 13M


Myself: 13F


Year 9




I'd promised yesterday that I'd go to an after school Creative Writing club with one of my greatest friends (we both love writing and practically breathe it). We arrived at about 3:04pm, pretty much 4 minutes after it was supposed to start, and there were tons of people (I'd guess year 10 or year 11) waiting outside of the room. Whether they were there for period 6 or for the club, I don't know, but I started to feel sweaty, hot and shaky in an instant. I'm not sure whether it's just because I don't trust large groups of people older than me or what, but at that moment in time I felt really uncomfortable and I ended up bailing and legging it to my bus about two minutes later. I apologized to R over and over again on Discord as soon as I got to my bus, but am I a tosser for abandoning him when he too was anxious about it? I feel really bad but he seems to have forgiven me",1579724296.0,0.67,1

"Really panicking about Wuhan Coronavirus. Hyperventilating and panic attacks, I just want this to stop but worry this is just the beginning.","First of all, I don’t mean for this to be triggering for anyone. If you think it is, please kindly back away now because I don’t want anyone to be feeling how I’m feeling. 

I replied to a post on this board yesterday about the Wuhan Coronavirus, but now I can’t take my own advice. I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder, but epidemics and pandemics are the worst of the worst for me. I’m a hypochondriac as well in my normal day to day, but this sends me into a tizzy. 

This might be the triggering part especially: Don’t get me wrong - I’m scared of death and the coronavirus myself, worried about losing my loved ones, my own life, etc. But I’m also scared of a societal collapse from an event like a pandemic. Obviously - we are no where near that stage now, but I play the what if game. I did just read online - not sure the validity of the source, but I did read - that the city of Wuhan (population of 11 million) is shut down and quarantined. That’s basically like NYC being quarantined and shut down which as far as I know, has never happened and is straight out of a horror movie for me. Also I can’t help but think - why would they shut down a huge city like that for a virus that was “just a cold” which leads me to be afraid that it’s really bad. 

I know I have no control of this situation, but I still worry. My husband and I were going to try to start a family soon (go figure - I finally felt ready lol) and now I feel hopeless about that and that even making it to next week without a global panic would be a blessing. I definitely don’t watch the news generally but of course I accidentally saw this on Facebook and went down the rabbit hole of googling. I just don’t (and I mean really I’m sure I’m not the only one) want to live in a post pandemic world in collapse If that is what it comes down to. There has been nothing but gloom and doom this year so that’s another reason why my mind goes straight to apocalyptic disaster :( 

I know I sound very irrational and I’m sorry. At a glance, I am a fully functioning adult with a good job and good relationships, I’m stable except for my anxiety like this. I try to talk myself through things and be rational but I can’t right now. I just want to go home, cry and get completely drunk LOL but I know that won’t solve anything. 

Does anyone have anything for me - I’m not looking for you to tell me “oh this will never happen” but maybe some coping mechanisms or thought patterns I could try. And yes I know I should get a therapist, but my what if game is telling me - what If everyone gets this coronavirus and you can’t see one :(

"Locked out of classroom, left the building instead of knocking to be let in","Basically the title.

Natural Anxiety Solutions / Medication Questions.,"Greetings Reddit! I'm making this post in an effort to help my Girlfriend who suffers horribly from anxiety on the daily and needs some help! Her anxiety is so bad that it makes her mind wander to places she doesn't want it to be and it can scare her and make her feel horrible. She's been suffering from it for a while now.  Her father recently stated that hes going to make her get on medication, which personally I do not agree with. I've read many things that are negative about anxiety medication and I am worried about her trying it. I am worried it could lead to negative side-effects or worsen other things.

So I am asking for help, natural remedies/solutions? Things she could try.. I just want her to feel better and not replace one thing with another.

Failed sex with my ex and she literally destroyed my life by telling everyone that i have erectile dysfunction,"Me and my ex have been together for 1.5 years with a lovely relationship at first, she loved me alot and has been the best gf i had .

We had no sex during this time because she wanted to stay virgin till marriage until one day she told me to make it from the back .

Unfortunately i was not able to have erection because i was on antidepressants and I couldn't tell her because she wouldn't accept it as for depression she would thought about it as psychological problems ( i know her very well ) .

She never allowed me to try it back again we only would make it out through ( handjob , blowjob,ect...) . And it was normal with erection for like 6 times and failed with two due to emotional stress i had .

One day after making out she dumped me out of the blue without telling me the reason saying im a good guy and treats women very well but we are not a match .

Me and my ex works together at the same place with people who know me and my family very well and found out that my ex told someone that the reason she dumped me for was my bad erection and that person spread it all around .

I know myself very well and i have no problem with erection and i know the reason that happened to this but i have been in a very had depression for 4 months because of what happened and I can't stop people from talking about it and girls started to avoid me because of my erection rumor ( can't get a gf anymore ) 

TLDR; i have no problem with erection but my ex spread it as i have erectile dysfunction and I can't get out of depression ( im dying inside everyday ) and I don't know what to do any help would be appreciated .

How do I stop anxiety rambling myself deeper into the hole in conversations... or is this normal?,"I find that this happens to me a lot, but usually when I get under 8 hours sleep which I really can't help because I have a chronic pain disease that wakes me up and I usually get 6 hours. It's just how I live, eternally tired.

My thoughts are cloudy coupled with OCD. It causes me to just burst things out and then have to backtrack but I never backtrack well. I feel like I don't have control. *Example:*

Today my friends (lets call them Jack, James and Danielle) and I were playing a board game. We broke for lunch, and while eating, Jack started talking (harmlessly) about his ex roommate (Tom) my old friend from college, who I knew were in a fight for two years but more recently I've become close friends with Jack and wanted to make sure Tom didn't do anything crazy to him.

After all, Tom has been estranged from the larger friend group and dropped off the face of the earth. I myself have had roommates who did this, and it was usually because they did something insane, and since Jack and I have only become close friends recently and now see each other twice a week, I wanted to ask to deepen the friendship and establish trust.

Without thinking, purely on newly-comfortable impulse with a new friend, I said ""what happened between you two?""

Everyone else in the room shot daggers at me. I knew I had done something wrong.

Jack sorta fumbles: ""Oh. I don't really want to gossip about someone I know you're friends with.""

Instantly I see that I am the asshole here, because it makes it look like I shit talk my friends. I didn't mean to do that. I panic.

Somehow, my anxiety brain digs the hole deeper: ""I just want to make sure Tom isn't crazy. The kind of guy who *hits people* or something. Uh, my last roommate did that (SHE DID, WE EVICTED HER) and uh, I dunno. I guess I wanted to know if he was crazy.""

James is confused ""I thought he was your friend? Why do you think he did something crazy?"" Now everyone is kinda looking at me. Jack sets off to explain the 100 things he hates about Tom, and now James and Danielle are staring suspicious daggers at me. They're probably thinking ""If Clear-Bandicoot says THIS stuff about her friends, what does she say about US?""

Jack finishes his story and it's super awkward. I've managed to make nice game lunch gossipy and bad. As he's telling me all these bad roommate things Tom did (passive aggressive, never paid rent, etc) I start going ""Aw that sucks, damn, yeah that sucks."" And I feel like I sound like a terrible friend.

I end it with him ""I didn't mean to open old wounds or anything! I was just trying to-"" Fumble again... ""Make sure he wasn't a murderer or something haha!"" God, my anxiety is in full control.

Jack kinda gives me a weird face. ""No. I don't wanna talk shit about him.""

We just go back to the game and I feel hung up and anxious about it the rest of the day. I don't like gossip or shit talking, my question came from a place of genuine concern. I haven't heard from Tom in a year and I wondered what he did. I didn't get to explain myself other than what was said there. I feel like I lost everyone's trust tonight due to anxiety. Or maybe it sounds worse to me? This new friend circle within the larger circle was a nice clean slate for me. My deepest fear is when people get close to me they will ""realize I'm bad"" (My OCD) and these sort of incidents reinforce it for me. What to do?",1579719852.0,0.5,0

Hoping saying this out loud in a safe space helps (aka: I'm even stressing over a title),"I pushed all of my friends away from me Monday. I'm worried my anxiety will break my friendship with them all and at this point it feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy. They say the first step to getting help is admitting you need help. I've got an appointment with a therapist Monday but it seems so far away and I need to get this off my chest. I used to be an optimistic, happy-go-lucky person. Now I'm always afraid my friends are intentionally leaving me out of things because they don't like me. In return, I constantly feel suspicious and distrustful of the people I love most. I can't even enjoy relaxing games and fun things with my friends because I feel like they are judging my performance and I feel like I have to prove I have a spot in that friend group based on stupid things like that. I miss them all so much but at this point I feel like I am running out of ""I promise I'll work on getting better"" chances. I don't know if this is the right place to put all this and it's definitely a wall of stream of conscious text, but I needed to see it for myself and say it out loud.

Hello ‘new to me’ group. Heart rate questions,"Hello fellow anxiety sufferers. I’m going to my dr tomorrow to discuss, but want to see what other experiences are re heart rate and anxiety. 

I have dysautonomia, which causes me to go into tachycardia and sudden drop in blood pressure issues. I’ve fainted hundreds of times since I was little and finally got a diagnosis after wearing a halter monitor for 2 weeks. Anyway.....

I got an Apple Watch since I live alone to keep an eye on things, but I rarely look at it because I don’t want to obsess. I’ve had loads of extra anxiety lately and on Saturday, thought I was having a panic attack when I was hanging with my adult kids. I tried to hide it, but I don’t talk when I am feeling like that so they knew something was up. I told them I was having a panic attack and didn’t know why. I didn’t check my watch until I got home and my heart rate was hanging between 145 and 152 for about 2 hours and then went down to 100 +/- until I was able to get to sleep (I took a 5 y/o klonipin I hadn’t thrown out). I was so uncomfortable because my mind was spinning trying to figure out why I couldn’t find anything to calm myself down. 

So, I’ve looked through my Apple Watch heart rate history and I see lots of elevated heart rate (usually around 120) for no apparent reason, but I’ve had loads of anxiety lately. My resting rate is between 58-62, so this is noticeable. 

Does anyone else have heart rate issues to this degree with their anxiety?",1579718641.0,0.67,3

Howto: Decide where to eat,"Bit of back story : my friend and I both have social anxiety and low self esteem. As often happens, we fell into a pattern of not asserting ourselves. We also have the abuse monkey on our backs, so when choosing what to do together we are used to deferring to others. A typical conversation between us used to go like this:


Me: Want to get something to eat after?


Her: I guess


Me: Where do you want to go?


Her: I'm fine with whatever.


Me: me too. Anything in particular you're feeling? 


... This goes on for awhile. It was hard for either of us to commit to anything and the discomfort at being drilled for an answer would prompt more anxiety. It was the same with what to watch on TV, or what to do for meal prep, and - well you get the idea. So we'd start avoiding it and suffering in silence. 


I tried taking turns but it didn't help - we felt guilty not letting the other person have input. We both wanted the other to be happy with the choice. So, we came up with a system to cut the guilt and fuss. It goes like this: we each suggest 3 places we're okay with. The other picks one they like most. Then we do paper rock scissors. If I win, we go to the one she picked off my list, and vice versa. 


The end result is win *or* lose we both had input on where we go, and there's no guilt because the chops decided out of the choices we had, which we were both okay with. Now we go out more and have fun doing it. It's like we tricked our social anxiety with a bit of slight of hand. It's fair, quick, and if one of us really does feel indifferent we have an optional ""rule"" the other suggests 5 and then we each pick one and do chops or sometimes I just say okay after and we go with whatever the other picked from our list. 


Maybe it's weird, but it's helped both of us be more comfortable giving suggestions without feeling judged or guilty, or that the other person might get passive aggressive or whatever because they didn't get their way. If you struggle with this with your friends, think about trying paper rock scissors or a variation. Its a way to create space so you or a friend can practice being more assertive without guilt.

Advice please?,"Idk if anyone can suggest anything etc etc
Its a long read, sorry guys.

So
I have had issues since a young age but ill summarise. 

Sexually abused as a child, by someone of the same age and gender as me but obviously more to it like i reckon she was getting abused etc etc else how would she have known certain things to do etc.
From about 10 onwards been under Camhs who diagnosed me with panic attacks and anxiety.
I.rarely attended school, had to sit at the back of the class else i was TERRRRIBLY anxious, shaky and fidgety etc and just walked out crying. 
Everyone put  it down to anxiety and panic attacks.
Then
Last January my doctor finally felt i should see  a psychiatrist- who diagnosed me with Bipolar and Panic attacks/anxiety.
I get months where im on a high, rarely panic attacks, not anxious, just living life,sexually active, shopping etc...then months of sadness anxiety cant even do things like walk down the road..i look a mess, just have 0 energy and go into a bit of a slump. 
Im on carbamazepine and sertraline.

I have so many worries and doubts like is it bipolar? Is it something more? Because im fine recently like my moods been good just randomly hormonal etc though, not even due on a period but just up and down a bit. Then today i go into a shop, come over all faint..dizzy...sweaty...light headed cant even speak properly and just need to get out asap. 
My eyes get all wide and just vacant and i feel like a zombie.
Is this normal with bipolar? Like why are my physical effects so bad!? Doctors just put it down to stress but i just wondered if anyone else has experienced the same thing as i am going out of my mind here.
I also have been suffering with severe pains in my stomach, nausea and just headaches CONSTANTLY. For months now, easily 6 months.

Social advice,"I feel strange posting here because I feel like my problems are not nearly as serious or consequential as a lot of the posts I see. I have depression, diagnosed BPD, and severe anxiety...

My current problem is that I just.. Miss social queues. I work in an extremely social, very high-pressure job.

Adulting Overload,"Life is coming at me from all angles right now and I just can't. I'm dealing with ongoing plumbing issues at home and at work that have me feeling unsafe and out of control. At home, we've been renting the same condo for 4+ years and it's been one issue after the next. Once, the kitchen flooded and it was months of living in a construction zone to get things back to normal. The drains in the sinks and bathtubs all back up constantly. Right now we have chunks of exposed concrete in the kitchen tile where they had to jackhammer through the floor to replace some pipes. Only a couple weeks later, they're saying they think it's leaking and they need to rip up the floors again. Every time these incidents happen, myself or my husband has to take time off work or rearrange our schedules to be here dealing with it. Also, my dog and cat are suffering and have to endure being crated or sequestered while workmen come and go and there is loud construction going on. We can't afford to move.

Meanwhile at work, the bathrooms there also have unreliable plumbing that has flooded multiple times. I'm the manager, so I'm responsible for dealing with it. We've called emergency plumbers countless times, costing time and money. I can't focus on my actual job because I'm always waiting for another disaster. It's become so traumatizing and anxiety producing that I've taken to fasting during the work day to try to avoid needing to go to the bathroom. The corporate management has not offered any sort of permanent solution. 

I feel like my life is covered in shit, literally and figuratively. I'm spending all my free time applying to jobs that hopefully pay more and/or allow me to work from home or closer to home to help mitigate these issues. I'm just stuck in this current living situation and job situation at the moment and I'm so overwhelmed.",1579712959.0,1.0,1
Anxiety BEFORE work meetings,"Hi,

Lately I have been getting anxiety attacks BEFORE meeting with other people at work, and I’m worried it is going to screw with my performance. Sometimes, reps come in from other companies and meet with me for training or check-ins - since I was recently promoted, this is new for me. About half an hour before they show up, my body starts FREAKING OUT even though I don’t mentally feel anxious. My digestive system starts getting trembly and I have to go to the bathroom, I get really nauseous and start feeling like I’m going to panic/cry. All the nasty feelings that come with anxiety you know?

Then the rep shows up and I start feeling better, and our meeting goes great.

I’m worried that one of these times I’m going to have an anxiety attack that I can’t recover from. Like I’ll be crying and dry heaving in the bathroom and will have to fake that I’m sick or something.

Any advice? I’m about to meet with someone in less than 10 minutes and I’m worried I’ll throw up.",1579712410.0,1.0,0
Living (and suffering) with high functioning anxiety,"Living with anxiety is fucking horrible. I forgot how terrifying my nightmares are. I haven't been smoking my cannabis since I've been sick and I just had the most absolutely horrifying dream. I woke up crying. I hate this. I never remember my dreams when I smoke. One of the biggest reasons I started smoking was because of my trouble sleeping. It's been more than 10 years since I've gone this long without it. And it's tearing me up. This is horrible. You don't understand what it's like Mom. When you tell me ""oh it's so bad for you, learnintofly"" -- I know -- you just don't understand. You don't understand what it is like to live with this absolute terror. 

Tomorrow I'm going to find a therapist, and I'm going to look into getting a therapy animal. 

I do want to reduce my dependence on cannabis, but it is literally the only thing that has ever helped me. 

Depression and anxiety, for me, go hand in hand, and it's a terrible existence. 

I tried to listen to some soothing music on YouTube and it's not helping. Even the stupid ""INSTANT RELIEF FROM ANXIETY"" video. So fucking stupid. There is no instant relief. Fuck you YouTube. And FUCK your stupid 15 second McDonald's ad you forced me to sit through before you would give me a chance at ""instant relief""

Did your medication f**k you up?,"I started taking taking effexor around December 2018, and in June 2019 I stopped gradually taking them.

I stopped the medication cause it was causing more problems than it solved.

I can't remember anything from winter last year, almost. I was reckless while driving, didn't give a damn about my wife, was always at the brink of mental breakdown.

Since stopping, it took 6 months to start sleeping again on my own without medication. Temper is better , but I feel that all I have left in me is negative thoughts, lots of frustration about anything really. Wife tells me there are a lot of improvents, but I feel so empty inside.  Can't do anything fun now cause nothing is interesting anymore.

The only benefit now is that I learned to say no to people. You all probably know what I mean. The pills gave me the courage to just don't care what happens with people or stuff, and I think I learned a lot from that. Now I feel I have less emotions overall, but I'm left with only frustration.

On the bright side I lost 50 pounds and look better than ever lol. But I almost never eat a complete meal, I just don't have the will to eat, so I eat cheese, chips, pogos and stuff like that even though my wife made supper.

So my question is, did your medication fuck you up as it did to me cause even though I feel a little bit better, I think it's time that helped me. I feel I am changed forever, and I don't think I like it one bit.",1579682342.0,1.0,6

Realisation,"
I met a seemingly eccentric and very smart individual at a party one year ago. They seemed nice, but they liked to show off (they liked to show they were the biggest brain in the room). Nonetheless i looked past it and he would pop up here and there ,he knows my best friends too.  This guy is curious, always wanting to know a lot and learn. He would always like to try to be the centre of attention and try to woo people, as I got to know him more and more he has an ego complex and he wants to be the dominant one wherever he goes.  Every interaction I’ve had since getting to know him, i dread it and I
Hate having to respond to him on fb.

More about myself i have black curly hair, green eyes and olive-fair skin(Mediterranean). Im skinny and around 5’10 and he’s a 6’3 dude russian from Estonia. I tend to joke alot and always out going and social. He takes the opportunity to touch my hair as if I’m a fucking dog. he did sambo and brags about it and likes to play fight with guys and tries to do that with me, which I really don’t like and only would do that with close friends. One time at a party he literally tries to touch my hair and a guy told him to knock it off, cos I was moving away, and the dude can’t seem to tell or judge body language. I tell him something,he’ll stop but he’ll do it another time. I didn’t know that telling someone not to do something meant, that “I’ll stop and do it again on another day”., cos that’s how i think he understands that.

He felt that my jokes have hidden messages and he had an argument with me about it as he feels it says a different story about the relationship. I’m not one for arguments, and i avoid them, but with him there’s been a good few arguments and disagreements with him only. I always have to end them and I felt bad about it cos i thought i hurt him I’ve never had any issues with anyone regarding my jokes, and if I argue, i keep it cool and as a discussion, and he said the other week I’m one for arguments, and I know myself that I’m not, neither do my friends say that.

He always cannot take no for an answer, i was at a bar with a
Friend and he came (by chance), i literally had to leave in 10mins due to work in the morning, but he told me to stay despite I couldn’t. So
I stayed 10mins. and thought fuck this shit I’m a man, i do what I want and I’m sure as hell am not gonna be talked down and controlled to by some ego centric fuck, and I left without a word and a pretty angry fast walk.

When he’s drunk he’s awful, he can be a violent drunk and looks for fights, me and my friends tell him not to and send him home, also he’s so rude when he’s drunk. That says alot about him.

I’m from a greek lebanese family based in Chicago(currently I’m living in englamd) but we’re muslim. Anyway  he asked a question about being muslim about how come we can’t do certain thing, told him. Then he kept digging and
Digging, and I told him i wasn’t comfortable with that. Sometimes i felt he would make a joke about my religion, and that digged deep within me


My best friend however isn’t too keen on him as well, he’s literally the only one I vent to about it and be knows how he is. I’m realising it’s a problem. My last interaction with him, I told him not to do something I don’t like. He went on the fucking offensive and had such a disgusting look as if he was ready to fight, I don’t know what the fuck he was trying to do and I do not give in to intimidation nor will I let anyone speak down to me in anyway (he loves to talk down to people) . but I shut him down and said I’m not in the mood for this , and went back to speaking to my other friends (who wee oblivious to what happened as we were in a loud party). But it had me thinking, what if the argument gets worse and maybe  physical ,  because i really don’t want to be around him, and I only have him on fb as to maintain good ties and as he knows my friends. I’m limiting it to just small conversations, small responses, and attempting to tolerate him. Thankfully I’m always busy when he tries to make plans with me, due to work and other commitments as hobbies, living with my little sister who to uni and other people who spend time with me and treat me with dignity and appreciate me. But I hate his personality, and his mentality. I don’t want to spread shit about him and about our conflicts, and I’m really uncomfortable with that.

I’ve concluded that he’s judgemental, egocentric, controlling, and will try to fuck with your head. Any suggestions on how to handle this situation as I really was pissed off today and it got in the way today. This guy seems so bad for my mental health, I’m not even exaggerating that.",1579704136.0,0.5,0

close friend doesn’t believe in anxiety,"i have a close friend who has always been incredibly supportive of me and a great shoulder to lean on. recently, i have relapsed back into back anxiety/panic attacks/etc. i’ve been considering going back on medication to make coping with this easier, but in discussion with my friend, he is unable to grasp the full concept. he thinks my problem is a result of over planning/over controlling, when in reality, that’s a coping mechanism for the anxiety i already feel. he tries to convince me that because people have always told me i’m anxious/suffer from anxiety, that now i believe i do and it’s real. like a placebo effect. which, again, is in reverse order. i suffered from the symptoms which lead people to diagnose me with anxiety. additionally, he’s skeptical that there is no “physical” test for diagnosis. because there is no blood test, brain scan, etc., conducted before diagnosis and prescription, he doesn’t think it’s accurate or valid. he think is it is more like a shot in the dark and adding to our over-medicated society. i have no good answer as to how the doctor knows the accuracy of the diagnosis, just that i choose to believe that their medical training surpasses my knowledge or a brief Google search. but because i can’t give him a concrete answer, he hasn’t made any progress towards believing the reality of this disease. he doesn’t recognize it as a real, physiological problem. (even though he has witnessed a panic attack of mine) and thinks it’s just the result of normal stress handled poorly. he has said he supports me and if it’s “real in my mind, it’s real to me” so he recognizes the difficulty, but it’s nearly impossible to feel true support from someone who doesn’t validate your struggle. he has been very fortunate to never struggle personally or have family members struggle with anxiety, but unfortunately for me it is hereditary so i am all too familiar. i want him to understand that this is a real problem that is generally out of my control. i am going all the journaling/deep breathing/exercise/planning that’s recommended, and as anyone with anxiety knows, that doesn’t always do the trick. 

how can i give him information and help him realize the validity of this issue? short of bringing him to a doctor and sitting him down to ask questions (seems excessive), i’m truly at a loss for how to explain this.",1579704060.0,1.0,4

Talentless.,"Please bear with me. Apologies for the hefty post.

I got promoted 4 times in the year 2019. First was an instructor post, then after 2 months, a senior role in operations. After 3 months, a managerial post, and after a month of the managerial post, I got upped to a regional post as manager for a group-wide project focused mainly on retail and digitization. And when the project ends, I was told by my superiors that I will be offered two big posts: the first one is in my home country, and the other is another regional post. I chose the former because I am planning to get married and my parents are quite old already.

Here are my key items regarding the progression contributing to my anxiety and the gaping void in me:

1. The constant changes in roles due to the rapid promotions have not given me enough time to get used to the shift in roles, which is confusing the hell out of me.

2. I am not resenting myself for being promoted. I have always wanted to actualize myself and better myself in terms of my career to feed myself of course, learn new stuff, be the best in anything, and for practical reasons.

3. The project I am currently handling now in the region is being closely monitored by the CEOs and regional department bosses. They terrify me most of the time but because I’ve had my fair share of presenting to them and talking to them, I think I’ve grown thicker skin.

4. I suck at business insights. I spend most of my time reading poetry and prose, art criticism, and theory and all of my life I’ve been mainly involved in operations. I suck at corporate. I don’t do well with office politics and struggle sometimes to not put myself in a very tight situation when it comes to speaking to stakeholders. Haven’t read anything about business and project management, and had not undergone training. I jumped right into these things professionally.

5. I get suicidal thoughts sometimes. I don’t have time to read my books, I don’t have time to join mass movements which I used to do before, and meet some friends who are local writers in my region to get sharp insights about a lot of things.

6. I get no performance feedback. The person I report to is really talented and insightful. The people I work with have a lot of experience in business, project management, etc. Since I am left to myself all the time at the office and out of office as I am overseas for the regional post, it’s just me reassessing myself everyday and my realization is that I suck. Most of the time.

——————————

I don’t know if I should be asking a question. Probably I just need a space to vent my frustrations and self-resentment and disgust. I don’t think this is impostor syndrome. It’s way too long for that already. I always get the sinking feeling that I suck, that I am not fit for this or anything else. And alongside, whenever I join meetings and hear someone who’s really brilliant, I grow a heavy sense of envy as I want to be just as brilliant, if not more, as the next guy. I am getting really frustrated and sleepless all because I hate myself for this. Maybe I just know how to pretend to know stuff about what I do and have my way sometimes with words but when it all boils down to the nitty-gritty of it all, I’m a talentless schmuck who faked his way to and through all of this. 

To cap this all off, I *may* not get the local post offered to me when the project ends because of reasons not concerning me, but of others, and this has caused me to hate and resent the wrong person: I hate myself because I was told by my fiance that I am too nice. This has given me feelings of uselessness and pointlessness. All my hardwork gone.

Like I said, I don’t know if I should be asking anything or what. Probably just need someone to talk to. Thought of consulting a psychologist but I’m having second thoughts about it. Maybe I’m just being plain weak and irrational. I don’t know anymore. I hope someone responds to this, but if none, then I guess this is just another wasted space.

Hope all of you are doing okay, at least.

Edit: Decided not to take the regional promotion because it would require me to move out of my hometown permanently and leave my life, my plans, and all the important people there. The compromise, the anxiety, the pressure, and the isolation are not worth it to convince me to take the regional promotion after the regional project management stint ends.",1579701967.0,1.0,0
Workplace stress and the anxiety aftermath. If I wrote a book this would be the current title. Ugh!,"For the past two years I have noticed a reoccurring pattern in my jobs and workplace mentality and I am not sure how to get out of this loop. I am very anxious and stressed at work to the point where I get stressed and angry. It's not that I get yelled at for things. I work super hard and am willing to help wherever I am needed and I know I am doing my best. The thing of it is that I never feel I am up to par. I feel like I am constantly under pressure and I am not getting feedback weather it's good or bad despite letting my bosses know ""let me know if I am doing something wrong so I can fix it"".  
  
In the last few years I did have a really bad work experience which I think really triggered my anxiety. There is more back story other than the work situation but I don't want to leave a booklike wall of text. Well just say I'm a natural worrier/fixer with a side of trust issues and a big glass of frustration (mainly at myself). I did a super small amount of therapy but it was expensive and while the therapist was nice I don't think she really understood where I was coming from. I'm single so no SO and family is pretty chaotic.    
I'm sick of feeling unsure, stressed out, depressed and angry. That's the feedback loop I am in and it happens constantly and it's exhausting. I wouldn't say I am lazy and don't want to work, but if these feelings were dialed back even 10% it would be really helpful.",1579701720.0,1.0,1

Confused very much," The last 3 months, thoughts without my will pop about a promise to an other God. Not Jesus. I worry and that creates a compulsion. My system suggests me to allow thoughts new thoughts without my will in my head, for a second, on purpose, that will be about a promise to the other God that the compulsion wont be done. Then, my system suggests me to maybe act as if the new thoughts without my will about not doing the compulsion, matter and say to my ocd this excuse that I am forced not to do the compulsion. it is a relief because I am so frustrated and i do not want to do the compulsion. Suddenly, these new thoughs without my will pop up and i feel relieved and able to ignore ocd compulsion without worries. Accidentally, I do the compulsion and I end up more worrying because I cant confirm if the new thoughts without my will were 100% without my will, cause they relieved me and for a second, maybe they looked like as if they are made on purpose. I am worried because these new thoughts without my will contain scary thoughts without my will about punishments that I try not to even think. I have reminded myself many times, not to fall in the same trap again but I fall a lot. it is like being frustrated and careless that I do not pay much attention to my thoughts without my will or my feelings and suddenly, I am like ""was that a promise or not? i am confused"" why i fall in the same trap? i know i will end up more worried but I fell on the same trap. I prayed to the other God and told Him not to accept promises and to protect me. but ocd tells me stuff like   ocd:  maybe the other God accepts your thoughts without your will because due to frustration, maybe you mean them, for a second. maybe Jesus is not real.",1579698841.0,0.6,0

Anxiety attacks,I’ve had panic attacks but oh boy this is another demon. I’ve been actually really happy these past two three days despite going through a breakup because the dude didn’t care about me and I don’t care about him.

Panic attacks,"I'm having panic attacks recently and very often. I'm aware of it. I know that it's happening and I can't really stop it the moment it happens. The only thing I can do is just breathe or close myself in a space and chanting mantras. I always want to bite myself when it happens. Especially on the wrist where I can see my blood vessel. I want to bite through it and lick the blood. But I'm controlling myself to not do that.

I always dwell on my past mistakes and wrong decisions thinking I could be better by just doing this rather than that. I hang on to my traumatic past (being scolded a lot by teachers for not doing the right thing, disappointing those who has high expectations on me etc.) and having panic attacks whenever I make a mistake now. I'm aware that I should seek medical attention at some point but doing that means that everyone is going to know about this. I hate being weak and I hate showing that in front of people. The internet is the only place to go. Nobody is going to judge and I want to find help here.

I'm aware of all of this but I can't do anything abt it.",1579696914.0,1.0,0
Does anyone else feel paralyzed because of fear? Cause I can't attend college because of fear.I'm bed ridden and failing all my classes.,"So I am here today because of the decisions I've made in the past.At the time it felt like what I was doing was in my best interest, I was wrong.I can't seem to forgive myself or let go of the past everywhere I go triggers PTSD. At this point my minds a mess so cluttered that I can no longer function normally not even in the slightest.I feel  sorry for myself, how could I let things get this bad.I remember being in class so out of energy feeling like I was gonna pass out, the lecture was going over my head even though I was trying really hard to concentrate my head kept wanting to fall back it was as if my body was weighing me down.I felt like I was losing control.Constantly trying to calm myself down but it was of no use.I kept picking at my shoe laces.I kept grinding my teeth cracking my knuckles every nervous tick I have was engaged, I was just praying that this would go away but it wasn't going away.My breathing got heavy and loud.Everyone in the room was staring at me.It was at this moment I felt truly scared that I was going to die, I remember thinking I want my mother around, I want my family around when I die.The worst part of all this was that I had eyes staring at me as if I was crazy.I had to leave the room, a girl in my class took me outside, I felt like I was a nuisance to her.I called home so someone would come pick up the pathetic excuse for a human that I am, I had a full blown panic attack... people who have never had panic attacks would never understand the extent of sheer fear and dread I felt.It escalated so quickly and a million thoughts crossed my mind. I somehow managed to reach home alive.I was utterly defeated.Cried a lot, I had to cover my mouth so I wouldn't make any noise.It was impossible trying to explain this to my parents 'cause they'd never understand.My brother would just tell me to deal with it.I was genuinely scared for my life, I wasn't worried about grades, attendance or my future.Because what's the use? I loathe what I've become and I don't see how I can ever turn this around.What a disappointment I've grown up to be.I hope I can learn to forgive myself and live in the present moment instead of dwelling in the past or dreading the future.Im stuck in limbo and there seems to be no way out.This feels like a pattern keeps happening to me.I claw myself uphill only to be dragged down in the end, I don't see any point in trying anymore.I don't see any way out.Seeing a therapist is out of the question.Can someone please offer me some advice, I'll take anything at this point.",1579696860.0,1.0,0
Need help with stress and toilet anxiety,"So... long story short. I have a problem since 2015. I was 18 and my grandma died, suddenly the minute I arrived to school I wanted to go to the bathroom to poop, 10 minutes later I wanted to go again. That lasted for like 2 weeks in which I would got to school and then call my parents to pick me up. Next years in college I had similar problems with bathrooms and poop.

Now I control this problem a lot better, but it's still annoying. I worry with days in advance about the path to places, where you generally can't go to the bathroom, like trains or cars. I don't have a problem with using public toilets, I have used the worst. There was a time when I stressed about using my own bathroom, because there is only one and my family occupies it too much. 

Sometimes it happens to me that, before going somewhere, I try to poop and I can't, and then when I get to the place I really want to poop. I feel like my body's my enemy. This problem has affected my motivation, social and love life very much. A strategy that helped me deal with this was, when I went out with friends, quickly drinking to get drunk, and so the problem was gone. But there was a time when I didn't even want to go out with my girlfriend for fear of making a fool of myself. Any advice is welcome.",1579696221.0,1.0,3
A game has been making me anxious for more than 3 years now,"Im a teenage female here, and there's this game series that i've liked for a very long time now. Im not going to lie, i was borderline obsessed, i loved it \*that\* much. The actual series isn't important, what's important it that it was a very story-heavy series that had to do with characters progressively dieing over the course of each game, so it's not inherently the happiest topic.

  


So a few years ago, the final installment of the series was announced to come out around late 2017- early 2018. I was pretty excited, and i was obsessively trying to avoid as many spoilers from people who played it early as possible. I'd use my hand to hide the google results when I'd search the series's name, and even deleted my instagram account(s) because spoiler posts began appearing on my feed. I'd literally feel my heart race and my breathing get heavier when i think i saw a spoiler, or when i see a theory video on my youtube recommended. Yet i'd think about theories, possible situations, character interactions etc \*all the time\*, it was literally impossible to focus in class because i thought about it so much.However, i always thought to myself ""I'll play the game and then I'll stop thinking about it, I'll be able to focus in class again, and that's all""

  


It still got worse though, as it turned into seeing absolutely \*anything\* about the series as a whole made me panic and the thoughts only got more frequent. I remember even telling my sister once that i wanted to get the game so badly already, but i was terrified of playing it at the same time. I didn't want potential favourite characters to die, to the point where i silently begged that they didn't, it wasn't a great time, since it was also the time when my IGCSE exam studies started to get more stressful, so not focusing in class was an even bigger source of worry due to how much i was obsessed with getting perfect grades, at one point i was even studying for 11 hours outside of school (on weekdays) so i would always gurantee perfect grades.

  


Anyway, the game finally gets released.My sister got me a physical copy and i had a one week break coming up.Perfect, i could finish it during that time and finally get it out of my head.Once i finally got my hands on it my excitement was through the roof.I'd literally wake up and immediately grab hold of my console and continue playing, barely wiping the sleep from my eyes.I ended up finishing the game (it was pretty long, at maybe 40-50 hours long?) in four days, and the worst outcome came to be.

  


I didn't like it as much as I'd wanted to.

  


In fact, i found it kind of disappointing, especially as a conclusion.

  


I pushed that aside though, and started going on social media fan accounts again to see funny posts and stuff, but for some reason I'd always feel uncomfortable going through the posts of people praising the game, characters i abhorred, or just memes in general. I'm not the type of person to get super angry when people like characters/shows/etc that i don't like, im usually pretty chill, but seeing these filled me with this anxiousness and an almost pain deep in my stomach.

  


I continued seeing fan account posts, etc for a few months after that, but one day i saw a post that particulary made me feel that pit in my stomach, it almost made me want to cry even though it wasnt sad at all, the comments on the post made that feeling even worse, so i went cold turkey and abandoned all the fan accounts, and for months i avoided the series like the plague.Seeing people with profile pictures of the series made my heart race and worsened the feeling in my stomach, and seeing people praise it made me feel even worse.It got to the point where prolonged exposure to anything related to it literally made me have to rush to the bathroom because my stomach hurt so bad.

  


The thoughts, however, didnt stop.The characters integrated themselves into my ""daydream story"" which is a continuous story in my daydreams that has also been going on for maybe 3 years.I dont think there has been a single day where i havent though about the characters of that game \*specifically\* ever since it came out.I even considered playing the game in its entirety again one summer and write down every piece of dialogue in that game and finally conjure up a huuuge post detailng every single reason this game is bad and disappointing.I actually dis do that for a part of the game, but i never continued due to how long it took, but its always been on my mind.

  


Seeing the actors that were in the game in different roles made me feel anxious, my siblings talking about the game because i had gotten them into it before the final game came out made me anxious, my sister got me a shirt of a character i loved and i can barely stand looking at it.

  


Lately its gotten a tiny bit better though, seeing people with profile pictures of the series doesnt make me super stressed anymore, but anything more than that? Yeah, definitely, but a little less than before.

  


In fact, the reason why i decided to write this is because i thought i had almost gotten over it, but i clicked on a video that just so happened to have someone wearing a t-shirt of a character from the final game that i very much hated, i hadn't even noticed until people in the comments pointed it out, and after that i just couldnt continue the video, the feeling of crying and the pit in my stomach returned, and i didnt want it to get worse, the knowledge of people liking that characters makes me unspeakably angry for some reason, and i dont know why, i dont know why i came to hate the game so much, a part of me knows i dont care, but a bigger part of me cant help but obsess over it.Im obsessed, and i dont know why.

  


This is pretty long, but i dont want this to continue.i want to be able to look at this game with a neutral mindset, but everytime i think about how much i dislike it i feel like crying.

Terrified of developing schizophrenia,"My dad’s dad had schizophrenia, my cousin has schizophrenia (related on my dad’s side but related through my dad’s mom’s sister not my dad’s dad or relatives), and my dad never got schizophrenia.

But I’m 22 years old and it could still develop.

What am I supposed to when my friend's buddy comes to my house?,"So I met this guy about two years ago in March 2018. We did have a sexual relationship that started the first time we met and ended in December 2018 because he ended up getting an STD from another girl and I refused to be sexual with him afterward.

Yesterday I went on a road trip with him and a buddy of his and we stopped at a hotel. We just hung out for a while and had dinner and then went to bed. His buddy slept in one bed and my friend and I slept in the other bed since this is the first time I met his friend. 



When we got to the hotel, my friend fell asleep right away but his buddy was still awake. He and I talked for a while and laughed about stuff. I got up from the bed and crawled into the bed with the buddy and we talked a little more. We started cuddling and kissing and I gave him head and then he ate me out. He wanted to have sex but I didn't want to have sex with my friend in the room. I laid with his friend for the rest of the night and then crawled back into the other bed with my friend before my friend woke up.



During the rest of the trip we just talked casually and everything was normal. 


Today his buddy texted me and he asked me if I want to hangout with him and I said sure. I told him he could come over and he said he could come over after he's done with work in a couple hours. H



He's coming over in like an hour. How should I greet or act when he gets here? What should we do when he's here?

Does anyone have any tips to stop seeing job interviews as a scary thing?,"Hi there! I quit my last job in June after deciding I’d had enough of being in such a toxic work environment, and I also decided to move out of state to a place that definitely has more opportunities and more likeminded people. The only problem is, all that change at once sent me into an anxious, depressed spiral and I’ve barely left the house since. I’m at a point where I need to be finding a new job.

Vent vent vent | please help | I’m sorry if I’m not good enough for you,"So my cousin Z died March 2018 at 15. End of spring break. I was in Disneyland. Happiest place on earth my ass. Was diagnosed with leukemia near the beginning of spring break. At the end of the week they got a brain bleed and died. 

I was never really close to them, and I feel guilty about that. Never really talked to them, and I feel guilty about that. Never spent enough tine together, and I feel guilty about that. 

At his celebration of life I found out he was LGBTQ+. That really opened my eyes. Am I actually a girl? Am I actually straight? I began questioning. Nothing felt right. I felt hopeless.

It was around June 2018 I got into a really dark place. I was depressed. I felt worthless. Hopeless. Like trash, nobody liked me, nobody wanted me. I started self harming. My legs, and my breasts.

Nobody bullied me. Nobody told me I’m ugly. The only people who actually insulted me was people online, calling me trash. I’m sorry I’m not good enough for you, I’m just doing my best. And I feel like all of my feelings are invalid, all the time. I have good teachers, good friends, supportive parents, stable income, I don’t go to bed hungry. 

I was on Wattpad one day, and I found the term Demiguy. I had some idea on what it was given it was Demi and guy, but I looked into it further. I saw light in my darkness. I found me. To go for so long not know who you are and then happening upon it one day online is the best thing. That October, I came out to my parents. October 11 (National coming out day) was the day I could truly be me. 

I got better. I stopped crying myself to sleep about all the guilt and how much I hated myself. I got clean. One whole year of not cutting. Then December 2019, it started again. I was cutting more than I did before. I went from my calves up to my thighs.

I don’t know what triggered this. I just got... sad. I started weighing myself, staring at all my flaws in the mirror. I started restricting calories. “I’ll never be beautiful or handsome until I’m thin.” I thought. I cut myself every time I went over my limit. I couldn’t control myself in a world where I need control. 

Christmas came and went. Got some cool stuff. Then my Aunt and Uncle and Grandmother came over new year day to celebrate a late Christmas. 2 very important things happened that day.

We exchanged gifts. My Aunt and Uncle gave me some of Z’s belongings. One of their Rubik’s cubes. One of their flannels. One of their hats. A sticker book they got. 

Why me? We weren’t close. I could tell my Uncle didn’t approve of me getting their flannel. I don’t deserve this. Don’t you need this? It’s your dead child’s belongings! I feel guilty. These things bring back bad memories when I look at them.

For my birthday, my Grandmother gave me copic markers. I obviously used them in some drawings, and she wanted to see them.  So my mom went to go look for it in my room. Instead she found my calorie counting book. And saw drawings that definitely weren’t the ones she was looking for.

Maybe 2 or 3 weeks later we talked. I told her everything. I don’t necessarily regret it, but I just wish I could turn back time. 

Everyday I think about my cousin. Sometimes I cry. Sometimes I don’t. I wish I could go back and be closer to them. Like I am with my other cousin.

One of my friends knows everything. I want to tell my other best friend. So that one day when I do have the confidence to wear a skirt without leggings underneath it I won’t have to answer any questions about my scars. Or be scared what they will say. I don’t know how to tell them. I’m scared they won’t believe me.

I made myself a promise. They say that I am comfortable in my own skin, my own mind, I will wear Z’s flannel. I’m still not in the best place right now but I’m trying. 

I’m sorry this is so long but I just needed to get all that out and tell someone the whole fucking story and not just bit and pieces. Sorry if I wasted your time.",1579677516.0,1.0,1

Nauseous but adrenaline kept me applying to jobs,"Haven’t worked or gone to school since last May after failing a semester at college then getting let go because I couldn’t work due to suicide attempt. Been in bed since sleeping 12+ hours with bad anxiety, depression, and BPD. Even though I started going to therapy again and have new meds, I’ve been deathly afraid of working or going back to school; I’m terrified I’ll end up with another meltdown or even attempt again from overworking because I don’t know how to set boundaries. But then last week, I just decided to apply for a job at the local humane society. Been randomly applying all night earlier, and I’m freaking out and dreading the phone calls if they even call which I kinda hope they don’t. I’m regretting this but not so yay?

Stomach in knots and ears ringing,"I’m home right now, meaning away from my girlfriend, who I’m in the process of moving in with at her parent’s place so I can get a job in her state and we can save for a place together.

I got a message from a potential employer in her state, that an event was going on tonight and I was invited to come. I was not promised the position, I was not even offered any details on the position, this was an opportunity to talk about those things.

This should be a good thing— however I am 2 states away and unable to go. I don’t even really want the job that badly but I feel awful about potentially letting everyone down by not getting it. 

I’ve been looking for a job since I graduated college and not only have I been rejected a lot— many distractions have come into play.

My girlfriend’s dad died, my aunt was diagnosed with throat cancer- I was the only one available to help her through the final stages of her treatment, obviously winter holidays and such, and just a couple weeks ago my girlfriend had major surgery, so I went to support her while she recovered— and her mother during that time relapsed with her addiction to opioid pain killers, and then her mother got an upper respiratory infection, all the while I have my own chronic illness to take care of, which has been flaring up seemingly non-stop— and I know these may sound like excuses but I genuinely have been filling out multiple applications and trying very hard to get my shit together.

This is the only position in the field I studied that’s responded to me. I feel like I fucked it up and I will always be playing catch up to everyone else because I’m just not cut out for this, or maybe I’m lazy, or just stupid, I don’t know.

I’ve been feeling my heart pounding for what feels like hours, and am so nauseated I feel like I’ll spew any second now. 

I’ve watched relaxing videos, I’ve told myself it’s not my fault they didn’t tell me about the event until the night of, and it’s probably not even a big deal if I don’t go, it doesn’t mean I won’t get the job but even if I won’t that’s ok because there will be more jobs, and I will apply for many, many more jobs. I have been taking my meds regularly but I just can’t shake the butterflies, the knots, the ringing, and the heart palpitations. I just want to go to sleep.",1579674857.0,0.67,1
HOSPITAL BILLS & THE INSURANCE COMPANY MAKE ME WANNA KILL MYSELF,"Hey guys, 
Sorry if what I am going to say is confusing because English is not my first language. 
I was hospitalized on November 21,2019 because I had a panic attack at school and they called 911. I was discharged on Nov 24 and I was diagnosed with MDD, anxiety disorder with panic attacks, cluster B personality traits, social phobia. I'm an international student (I'm living in Canada), and I do have insurance. 
But the thing is, the process takes forever and I'm going crazy! After many days, the hospital has been sending 3 letters, calling me and asking me to pay the bill as soon as possible. The last one was sent to my new house last Sunday. They said it was their final notice. My boyfriend was the one who contacted the insurance company since the first day I was in the hospital until now. The company was completely quiet after we sent them all the medical records that we received. I just tried to contact them and email them last 3 days and after 2 days, their response was "" Your claim is still under review by the Claims Department. "". 2 hours later, they sent me an email and ask me to send them tons of medical records/notes from the hospital in Canada and Vietnam (my home) BEFORE FEB 19. It drives me crazy because I'm going home soon (Jan 25 to Feb 15) and I tried to contact them SO MANY TIMES but they didn't say anything. 
There is also another problem that my 1 of 3 psychiatrists wrote that I was hospitalized in Vietnam in 2017 (which is a misunderstanding, I only told him that I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist back in 2017). When I told the insurance company the truth, it seems like they didn't really care because it was written on the actual paper. What can I do? 
My friend had a same case with me and they refused to pay the bills for her because ""she already had those mental illnesses before she came to Canada"". $8000 is a way too big amount of money to my family rn. I have been having so many bad days since the first day of 2020, exams are coming in a day and thinking of all these shits drive me crazy. 

What should I do now? Please give me some advice..",1579674405.0,1.0,0
Tips for overthinking and first day back at school/college?,"Hi, I’m an art major in college and I’ll be going back to class next Monday for the first time since the first day of last Fall, when I had to drop my classes because I kinda had a panic attack.

My anxiety mainly stems from my self-esteem and the social anxiety. I would get overthinking thoughts like:

 “I’m not gonna do very well in the class, so I should drop before it’s too late.”

“I look stupid, my art is stupid, why am I even majoring in art if I suck so much? Man his/her art is so much better than mine. Dang it.”

“I want to make friends, but how do I do that? I also wish I wasn’t so quiet, but I make myself quiet because I’m bad at conversation and relationships in general. And because I’m too quiet everyone thinks I’m a weirdo which makes me anxious. Dang it.”

I’m actually on depression/anxiety medication now since I dropped classes last semester and I’ve been seeing a therapist who is now on maternal leave, so I’m a bit more prepared this time around. I’m determined to stick it through and not let my overthinking get in the way of my passion but I’m also scared that I’m gonna overthink again and be a mess. 

I’m trying to brace myself at this point. I’m looking forward to my classes but just a bit nervous.

Can anyone else relate? If you do or don’t, what coping strategies or tips do you have for this kind of thing? 😅",1579674105.0,1.0,1
I feel like my mind isn't working well at all,"I feel like my mind isn't working well?
I've felt like this since 3 and half years ago when I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder...I feel like I can't concentrate at all, and I have a little bit of trouble at procesing information which has made me a bit slower (let's put it as if we were computers, I would sometimes freeze or it would take me longer and more work to finish taskes) The way I percieve things or process thoughts and information is so different to the way it was before, even sometimes it feels like I'm not here at all, I also struggle learning, handling my emotions, liking things, imagination creativity, it is hard to take desitions, I'm clumsy, I feel like my mind is so tired, etc(it is so hard putting it into words). All I want is to my mind to go back the way it was before... It is so frustrating to not being able to enjoy life at it's fullest like other people do. I don't know if any of you have felt their minds  this way too, please let me know. I'm thinking on going to a psyachrist and start taking meds. My psychologist says that the best way out is taking an antidepressant med so I can calm down, but I think a better way out is taking a med called ritalin which boosts links between braincells... have you ever felt like this?
Pd: Before new year I started doing some acticities which aren't so exigent to my mind and I started feeling a bit better, but some days ago I stopped amd yesterday after a moment of several stress, anger and sadness I started feeling a bit like this again...",1579674101.0,1.0,1
A freind is driving me to the edge,"So, I'm not super social but can hang with a few people. I'm in history class and the topic of ww2 came up. I talk to this kid about it for a bit shedding our knowledge on the subjects. The next day we talk a little more, small talk, history facts. As days go by he gets more chatty. He's kinda extroverted and a little overbearing by then. Im kinda thankful we only had one class together. Soon he gets way too close and flirty. I have no problems with flirty but I need space. I've told him to back off a little because I need space. He does for maybe a minute, then he does it again. I've had a bad past when it comes to people so I need distance for the most part, so it spikes my anxiety. NOW HE FOUND MY LUNCH TABLE. At lunch I always sit alone, no matter how many freinds I have. His freinds stop by, and they are loud and noisy. I'm a tiny female, I dont like conflict, and this keeps scaring me.

I can’t watch the news,"I try to stay positive. If I were to think about all the horrible stuff in the news I would just curl up and stay in bed, shaking my legs and nodding my head. I can’t watch scary movies anymore, I only watch comedy movies and tv shows about light hearted stuff. There’s a lot more but right now. My demon might be reddit. 

Reddit has some really wholesome stuff sometimes, and of course a lot of memes (that i follow) but this plague stuff has be almost to tears. I can’t deal with it. I am terrified of dying. I have health anxiety from having preeclampsia while pregnant and near stroke numbers. The thought of a the plague..... I am so so scared. I have two kids and having anxiety makes me wish I didn’t have them sometimes. I don’t want them to have to deal with illness or loosing me.  I want to keep them home and sanitize the house and keep them healthy.  

I don’t know how to do this. I try to keep my kids safe but what if their father, I or even them gets it???? What do I do? I can’t lose them.. and I don’t want to leave this earth. When the scenarios of “if you had 10 million $ what would you do with it?” And question like that I can only think about how I would be able to build an area for my husband, my children and I to be safe. If I get sick now I’m just another woman. Some tick on a chart.  I just want to live an uneventful mundane life and grow old with my husband.

I quit my job today due to social anxiety,"So long story short, I quit my job today because I felt so anxious I thought I might have had a panic attack if I stayed. This is a new job for me and I had only been there for a month. It was a restaurant job (not something I’m used to AT ALL). I’m really not used to working around that many people. I’m pretty sure I heard a group of my coworkers talk shit about how quiet and reserved I am and how “all I do is say Hi and that’s it”. It made me feel like absolute garbage because I hate small talk with everything in me but I was trying to be polite enough by at least telling everyone Hello everyday, apparently that wasn’t enough. I can’t handle people criticizing me like that and my self esteem had plummeted to the point where I felt even more reluctant to talk to them. I’m the type of person who likes to just go, do my job, and go home. I’m starting to realize people don’t respond to that too kindly. I feel so guilty and pathetic because I walked out today and didn’t even have the courage to tell my boss in person. I texted him telling him I couldn’t do it anymore. I’m so pissed at myself because this was a good paying job and for once I was actually doing financially well. It took my months to get a job and now it’s all gone because I couldn’t get over the fact that people dislike me. I’m so socially inept when it comes to coworkers that it’s driving me to quit things I otherwise enjoyed. 

Now I’m jobless and stressed about needing to find somewhere new. At the same time I want to actually find somewhere that suits me better, but realistically in the small town I live in that isn’t likely.

Hypochondria and phobias are taking over my life again,"I have suffered from generalized anxiety and panic disorder since I was a child due to a neurobiological illness I suffered, so this will be a life long thing for me, but it changes in type and severity over time.

For the longest time I suffered from ementophobia. Even someone saying the word ""vomit"" could catapult me into a panic attack. All of my anxiety and OCD is all somatic, I’m constantly hyper-aware of my body’s well being, previously with my stomach but now since the ementophobia has phased out, it has all been surrounding my throat.

I can’t exactly pinpoint exactly when I developed a fear of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, but I think it has been there for a while and just grown with time. I capitalize on avoidance behaviors, I haven't eaten a pecan since I was in the 4th grade and I'm 22 now. I even found out I wasn't allergic but since it had been so long that I had been avoiding them, I still won't eat them. Not necessarily because I'm still actively scared, but because they have a negative connotation to me now and I just can't bring myself to eat them again, even if I have no real reason not to.

I don't even have any known severe allergies. I have a couple minor ones but I dwell on them like they could kill me. I am allergic to cats, beer, marijuana (self diagnosed through exposure issues), coconut, and pineapple. I also have a couple that showed up on a food sensitivity test and since seeing them on there, I am too afraid to eat them, even after eating them plenty of times before. I used to eat eggs often, but after they showed up, I refuse. For a while I wouldn't eat anything with eggs even as a minor ingredient in baking/cooking, but I slowly reintroduced those foods back. Still can't eat them alone though. Other things showed up like green beans, cabbage, kale, onion, potato, sweet potato, cantaloupe, orange, and cinnamon. I used to love cinnamon and cinnamon rolls but now I feel like I can never eat them again. I have my food sensitivity test results saved on my phone for constant reference, I double check things that I know I don't have a problem with but still worry about anyways. Recently I have been randomly getting hot and flushed cheeks during eating, and I am already journaling everything I eat when it happens so I can narrow it down to what it is. I think it might be just when I eat excess sodium but it still causes me to panic every time it happens. 

I do unfortunately have issues with my throat sometimes. I have GERD that causes occasional swelling in the base of my throat which caused a lot of anxiety for me. For a while, I understood how to recognize what it was and work myself through my fears, however, recently it’s been harder to identify and I don't know if it’s my anxiety working harder or if the sensation has actually changed.

I had an incident in July of 2019 that caused a major relapse of my anxiety. I have had my anxiety really well managed for years and even though I would have my moments, for the most part I was doing just fine on a basic dose of SSRI and almost never had to take benzos because panic attacks were rare. I'll admit, my mental health was already incredibly weakened because my father passed June 2019, so when I woke up on the morning of July 4th covered in hives, it was literally closest to my worst nightmare come true. I was having an allergic reaction. Worst part is that it took 4 days to clear up. It felt like the equivalent of having to look down at your body and see it covered in leeches; seeing the red raised blotches everywhere and constantly literally drove me to insanity. I would take medicine and it would subside for a few hours, but they would slowly come back and I would breakdown into tears every time. I was having 3-4 panic attacks a day. I refused to eat anything but white rice, plain potato, grits, and peas. I don't know why I decided these foods were ""safe"" but it was all I could do. I lost so much weight. I finally got an allergy test done and was able to slowly work foods back in a week later, but it took me a little over a month just to recover from the trauma of the hives, which after considering all options, was probably due to a medicine I was taking.

My panic attacks are as close to the feeling of fear before you die as I can imagine they could be. Every time I see panic attacks described in textbooks or on TV, I feel like I'm suffering something much much worse. My minor panic attacks are akin to what they describe, but some of my worst ones ever involve pacing (sometimes at the rate of running), crying, yelling, and self harm. Like these are way more rare but I look like I belong in an institution. More minor panic attacks can usually be worked through but attacks like those have to be stopped with benzos. It’s genuinely the most terrifying feeling in the world and I can barely begin to describe how god awful it is to live though.

I'm incredibly terrified of anaphylaxis. I can't even put it into words. I have no health insurance so I carry around my deceased fathers expired epi pen from 2016 even though I know it wouldn't help me. I still can't bear to part with it, it like a security blanket. Other than this, I carry an old inhaler I got for bronchitis or something years ago and LOADS of Benadryl. I've taken so much Benadryl in my life that doctors are a little worried about the effects it may have on me in the future. Because of this, I do only take it now as a last resort, so maybe only 0-2 pills a month. 

It terrifies me that you can develop a life-threatening allergy at any point in your life. I could just go out to dinner and eat something normal and die. Some people even have reactions by just being near someone else eating the allergen. Any time I get vaguely itchy for any reason or no reason at all, I begin to subconsciously worry and it's like I can't stop unless I’m properly distracted. If my throat is itchy or minorly swollen for any reason, I can't stop clearing my throat, drinking water, forcefully breathing, etc either until I calm down or if the anxiety progresses otherwise.

I am very scared because in a month I am moving to a new country to start a job. I have lived there before for a couple of months for study, back when my anxiety wasn't as bad, and I did alright, but my fears are much more present this time. The country is very well known for not understanding food allergies and not really caring in general as it is not very prevalent there. People literally recommend that if you suffer from a severe allergy, don't go there at all. I know logically that I don't have a severe allergy and all of my minor allergies are avoidable, but I have a feeling that if I have enough worries here in the states, I am going to be tormented there. I'm scared I will go and fear everything I eat or I'll accidentally eat something I am afraid of and have a major panic attack in public. Or worse case scenario, I'll develop a severe allergy and go into anaphylaxis in a restaurant and maybe not even get help in time.

'm just so scared. I'm scared over stupid shit that may never happen to me but it’s something I think about multiple times a day, every single day. I can't pick food that just sounds good, I have to thoroughly scan through the ingredients and ask the restaurant what it’s prepared with. I don't know what to do and it’s going to impact my future if I move and my problems increase. I will be teaching from 9-5 and that means I am in a classroom with children and I can't just go home if I am having issue nor will I be able to step out to calm myself down. I google too much and I worry too much and I don't know how to stop the fear of everything I eat and do. Even some smells freak me out but its not as bad as things I eat.

First Day Of College And I Already Think I Messed Up,"So, today I started school back up again, only had one class today. For some reason I’ve had a lingering worry even though nothing went wrong during the class. 

After class I did some reading that we were assigned for that day to get done before next class, I also looked to see what I needed to do for the first day of another class. While looking at the class schedule and syllabus I found out I needed to do reading before class. But above it it says welcome but we didn’t have class.  So I tried to get access before to try and read the textbook but it wouldn’t let me access it. 

Now after repeating this exercise of closing the laptop, staring at my bed and trying to find something to do. I did this 3-4 over the span of a hour, and I have absolutely no clue what to do. I am out of energy and I just haven’t had this happen until school started again. So I don’t know if it’s just my mind getting worried about school or what. But I just don’t want to be the only to show up that day and be unprepared for the class. And end up falling behind in the course.

A Week Of Mixed Feelings...,"This week has been a time of big change. The best thing is that I aced all of my final exams for my first semester of high school. I scored top in my class on 2 of them, and even though I felt sure I was going to fail most of them, or at least do bad, I got score after score last week, 91, 94, and 96. I felt on top of the world for a bit. Then I took my last one Thursday (Last day of school last week), and I felt very nervous, because I actually set myself a goal to make over 90 on all of them, which is the first academic goal I've set in a while. I was anxious for my score, when, 2 days later, the girl who I've shared a very close, loving, amazing relationship with for a year and 2 months decided, long story short, to end it because she ""Lost interest"". This has made me hurt immeasurably, even after I got my score for the last subject, which was a 99. I'm basically in tears now, it's midnight, and I go back to school tomorrow for the first time since Thursday, and start 4 new classes.

Anxiety is a bitch,"I have this big fear now that I’m going to completely ditch what I love, being a musician, to be a dancer. I’ve recently started to just randomly dance to songs I listen to and my brain decides to bring up the lovely idea that sometime soon I wouldn’t enjoy playing anymore which is such bullshit and I know it, my brain knows it, but then anxiety comes in and overrides my reason. I fucking love music. I plan to pursue a career in it as a performer. I’ve put so much effort into and I refuse to let a single, fleeting thought ruin it just because I like to indulge in another activity. I draw, and paint, doesn’t mean I’m going to let that override my passion for music and playing. I am a performer at heart. A musician, not a dancer. Even if I enjoy dancing to a good song and getting pumped up music makes me feel whole. It’s the music that makes me dance too. And knowing I’ll be able to make music that inspires people is what I look forward to so I’ll be damned if I let my questioning mind wander into stupid thoughts.",1579668525.0,1.0,0
"When is it a warning ""Gut Feeling"" and when is it ""Just Anxiety""?","Hello, I'm new to this subreddit but due to spikes in my anxiety lately I'm being driven up a wall and thought I'd reach out and ask for some advice (I should add I have been dx'd w/ paranoid personality disorder, PTSD, depression & generalized anxiety disorder). Have not had access to a psych for over a year and I think it's costing me.

Anyway for context I've always had this strong gut feeling whenever something rather awful is about to happen - my stomach twists itself up and a more physical type of anxiety strikes. I've dodged many figurative bullets before by listening to this feeling. Very often I can predict whether a situation will become dangerous or not based on whether I get this feeling or not. It's different from regular anxiety and I think I've seen a few others here say they get the same type of feeling and have had success listening to it. Right? Isn't that something folks with anxiety often have? An internal harry potter scar of sorts? lol

I know that lately I have been getting more paranoid, and sometimes it gets fairly irrational. Without a psych\* it has become very difficult all over again to reign this in, and oddly it gets worse at night(??? No clue why). There are some upcoming things I am catastrophizing about (meeting online friends in person for example) and I recognize that is more than likely a product of anxiety/paranoia/the fucking news lately, but I keep wondering if what I'm feeling is a genuine warning like what I described above. How can you tell the difference between the two feelings?

tl;dr - **My question is: how do you know when it's** ***that*** **type of thing you're feeling - that warning sign anxiety - vs. standard exacerbated anxiety or a more quiet anxiety attack?**

\*I had an incredible psych who helped me tons with this, but she was part of my university psych team, so I could only see her while I attended. Now that I graduated I can't seem to find a decent psych anywhere near me under my insurance. RIP.

P.S. I may be making absolutely no sense. It has been a long day but I tried my best to articulate what I'm feeling here. If I sound positively bonkers please feel free to point it out or be blunt with me haha. Any and all responses are appreciated!",1579668455.0,0.67,1

Anyone else have a memory searching mode?,"Some days I just do not feel well and it affects how I think.  But these days with better health, my mind likes to wander to all kinds of thoughts.  Like it’s free to roam.  There’s two ways.  Directed thought, and flow thinking.  I’m much, much better at using flow thinking instead of directed thought.  And it entirely revolves around my health status.

And I’ve grown a strong ability to reconstruct memories through imagery, whether it’s exact imagery or a way to move through the thoughts.  Only because I’m more apt to think in imagery.  I’m also very good at recalling what I did recently in vivid imagery and even feeling, but only when it matters or seems vivid/novel/interesting/important.  I’ll just randomly recall what I did at the grocery store, but I can’t recall where I put that glass of water.  It all depends if I’ve turned the switch on in my brain to look around my mind and see what good stuff is going on.  Negative things only seem to come up when I don’t feel well, but I will confront things when I feel well too.

It’s more that I’m not the type to remember words that much, moreso a more vivid reconstruction of what I felt then, and what was going on around me.  I had no idea I was naturally observing, because my brain has many of these memories to go through from past and present.  And many times I’ll return to a memory and find something new I forgot about.  It’s very nice sometimes to be able to run away to past feeling to help current feeling.

I used to be good at random mental imagery, still am, but I think my brain has more borders up from past anxiety.  I used to go to bed imagining whatever my brain gave me, and they were connected thoughts, but now it’s usually only when I wake up, and close my eyes again, am I able to have a movie go on behind my eyes and think through imagery.",1579667650.0,1.0,0

I was 18 and my grandma died, suddenly the minute I arrived to school I wanted to go to the bathroom to poop, 10 minutes later I wanted to go again. That lasted for like 2 weeks in which I would got to school and then call my parents to pick me up. Next years in college I had similar problems with bathrooms and poop.

Now I control this problem a lot better, but it's still annoying. I worry with days in advance about the path to places, where you generally can't go to the bathroom, like trains or cars. I don't have a problem with using public toilets, I have used the worst. There was a time when I stressed about using my own bathroom, because there is only one and my family occupies it too much. 

Sometimes it happens to me that, before going somewhere, I try to poop and I can't, and then when I get to the place I really want to poop. I feel like my body's my enemy. This problem has affected my motivation, social and love life very much. A strategy that helped me deal with this was, when I went out with friends, quickly drinking to get drunk, and so the problem was gone. But there was a time when I didn't even want to go out with my girlfriend for fear of making a fool of myself. Any advice is welcome.",1579666778.0,1.0,1
Dizziness and weakness due to anxiety,"So I didn’t get much sleep last night. 

And I was busy doing schoolwork and going to classes from 8am to 8pm (nonstop homework and class work, I felt super productive all day).

I had a bit of anxiety after my day was over and I started to settle down for the night. I didn’t think my anxiety was any worse than the average night however, I have been feeling quite emotional these past few days and I’ve been having anxious thoughts more often this month than I have any other month. 

Anyways, I started feeling dizzy (only lasts a couple seconds) and then my hands felt shaky and now my whole body feels weak. 

I know these are symptoms of anxiety and I can’t think of anything else that could be causing it. 

I figured it’s from a combo of tired and anxious for a long period of time. 

Does anyone else have these symptoms when they get only a little bit anxious?",1579666242.0,0.67,2
Does resisting work?,"How do you guys manage to enjoy life? My anxious trigger is food/eating. I find myself obsessively doing math regarding calories/macros and end up eating every hour or so wether I’m hungry or not. This obsession is totally keeping me from enjoying any hobbies or activities. I can’t shake it at all. I go to bed waiting for breakfast then eat ~800 cals as soon as I wake up even though I logically know I don’t HAVE to eat right then.

Anyone experience 24/7 anxiety that can last weeks? Or is my anxiety unique?,"Since last Saturday from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep, I am frozen with crippling anxiety.

I’m wondering if anybody else has ever experienced this?

As I feel alone, and like I am a special case of anxiety that perhaps nothing will work for.

It’s made living hell, as I simply can’t do anything other than be in bed meditating. I miss the old me so much.",1579664450.0,1.0,17
My roommate makes me feel unwelcome in my own space and it makes me anxious.,"I feel like I can't tell her anything bothers me because it's somehow always my fault. I'm moving in a few months but for now I'm stuck in this lease. It makes me so anxious to hear her because I feel like something is going to get thrown in my face. 

I don't really want to give any more specifics, but I really am tired of feeling this way.",1579664424.0,1.0,2
