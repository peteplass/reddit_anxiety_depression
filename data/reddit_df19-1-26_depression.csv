Depression and love ?,"
Hi all! I’m new to the thread and I came here to see if anyone can relate to my story, or if anyone can provide insight as to how I can go about handling everything correctly. Im a almost 22 year old female in love with a 23 year old tortured soul. As dramatic as that sounds, that’s how it’s been for the past year and some months. Before getting into our relationship, I was unaware of his depression, he didn’t tell me the extent of it for fear that I would run off. I haven’t. And I won’t. In fact, for the better part of our relationship he expressed that I HELPED his depression, I took him out of him mind, of our the darkest parts of him that wouldn’t let him function. And I was proud of myself for doing so actually. Then came the worst year of my life, with school and work and family all caving in on itself, I turned to him for support. Like an angel, he was there when I needed him. Then things got bad, I couldn’t be the light that kept his depression away during the tougher times, I didn’t have any light myself, this caused us to not be able to go to each other in our darkest times. His depression got worse, I only felt more and more alone. Things got worse before they got better. I’ve been growing, bettering my situation. I have found the light in myself finally, and now I want to help him find his. Sometimes we can be really great together, only for something to happen in which he says something to upset me or disappoints me in some fashion and things get lost in translation and we try to talk it out .. but it’s too late .. the depression hits him. The man I love is gone, and what’s replaced him is the worst thoughts, the worst things to come out of his mouth. What causes it to come back and hit him hard is a situation that he is unable to fix in the moment, and my own feelings getting the better of me and me basically popping off. See, he can be the best man in the world for maybe a week straight, bring me lunch, say all the right things, the there for me morning and night. But when we go through one of our rough patches, that man is gone. And the fact that he can’t fix it in the moment makes him go so far from me that I don’t know how to bring him back. To the extent where he tells me he wants to be alone, just alone. And it’s happened before, and I’ve been the one to guide him out, and he’s told me how grateful he is for it, how grateful he is that I stick by him. But sometimes the depression makes him say the most awful things, and it affects me. It’s like from one day to the next he’s a different person. I’ve never met anyone like him, as amazing as him, yet also with this illness that he is suffering from. I’ve found that music helps, affection as he is slipping helps, but sometimes I’m not even capable of that myself. And that’s when things get really bad. How can I help him when he’s so far gone ? It can last for about a week, maybe more if I don’t do anything about it, before I see the man I love back in his eyes. I know I should give it time, but how much ? The depression has caused him to leave me for my own good before, only for him to say it was the worst mistake he’s ever made. And I’m not going to let it happen again. I want to help him, grow with him. We both have things we need to work on, I know, but I’d like to know if anyone who’s currently with the same thing can shine a light on how to go about things when we’re at this point. Whatever disagreement we had is in the past, I told him it’s not worth seeing him like this. My priority is to help him come back to me, because I know that it doesn’t let him do that on his own. Sorry for the long post but thanks for reading :)

Tl;dr : loml has depression, sometimes triggered really bad when our relationship gets rocky, how can I help without him telling me there isn’t anything I can do. How can I get to the him that’s trapped inside the darkness ? The emptyness ? 

Thanks again !!",1580094425.0,1.0,0
stuck,i’m the only one who has no clue what i want to do with my life. the things i wish i could do i know im not good enough for and i honestly dont even think ill be alive long enough to even have to deal with figuring out what i want to do. life is so hard and its like i wanna keep going but every once in a while i realize im really not okay at all. im just really distracted and sometimes when i get really sad i scare myself because i 100% feel like im going to hurt myself and i dont want to. i want to have hope that things will come together but ik they wont. so im just living .. and patiently waiting for something to change because i dont want anybody to be sad if i leave. but then again i always wonder whether i will be genuinely missed if i was gone. i wish the people im trying to stay strong for knew that im living for them. but i dont want them to feel pressured or feel like their actions need to make me happy.,1580094195.0,1.0,3
What am I supoosed to do with my life?,"I have a job, I make money. My life should be totally fine.

But then again I know I have no friends, I know that no one likes or loves me. I know that my job doesnt make me happy, the things I buy dont make me happy, my life.. is.. boring and meaningless.

All I feel is loneliness, helplessness.. I feel as if nothing I ever did or ever will do has meaning.

WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO BE HAPPY?

I want my life to have meaning, I want to be happy, I dont want to die, knowing that I died for nothing, that my death doesnt have any meaning. That's my biggest fear.",1580093854.0,1.0,0

"Sick, alone and just broken","First I'm not a native English speaker, and not at all active on Reddit or anywhere else for some time.

A few things about where I'm coming from - I'm 25, I'm a student, I moved to France for a good education and a better life, my family was and still is poor, I got very sick out of nowhere and now I don't see the point
in trying to carry on.

Since this summer I wake up with a swollen face and fingers, I have always a headache and a pain in my back that rarely goes away, also I have a very hard time remembering things, learning new things, even talking to someone is hard because I don't remember simple shit (seriously, sometimes I forget what I ate for breakfast, I'm not even joking).
Sometimes my dick isn't working, and i have trouble peeing, shortness of breath, and weakness...

Doctors say it may be ckd among other things, it's a long story.

My girlfriend left me, this time forever, i also liked someone else very much after that, and I lost that too, because I wasn't thinking straight, I wanted to explain everything, but you can only explain when someone wants and needs your explanations.
And at some point I just lost the last bit of hope.
Loneliness is killing me.

Sometimes I can't stop crying, and I don't know what to do.

I feel like I lost everything, and I can't fight my monsters anymore, I think about life, and what makes us wanting to live, I think it's hope and maybe love. But something broke inside me, there is a thought inside my head that gets under the spotlight more and more often, and it's saying that there is no escape, and I won't have a normal life, not tomorrow, not after one month, not ever...

So, why even try, why go through all of this, when hidden in this fog are only deception and pain.
Sometimes I want to just die in my sleep, to not feel all this pain and these emotions, I don't even know why I'm writing this, i wasn't always like this, I guess I'm just weak....",1580093595.0,1.0,0

TW First time cutting,"TW!!!!!!! 

&#x200B;

Today i cut my wrist for the first time. I bought a piercing kit last week to pierce my friends belly and my septum so i ha a lot of sharp needles left. After piercing my septum i realised that i didn't feel any pain and it gave me a sense of relief that i longed for. Today i was sitting in my dorm and i had an urge to try it out and see and it liked the feeling so much that i went at my wrist for about 30 minutes and now there's so much blood but me being the so called perfect  person i am i cleaned it up properly and wrapped it good so no one could see. I can't let people know what i've done to myself. My family would be so disappointed.  I like the feeling but i know it isn't good for be because i'm the type of person to get addicted easily. i'm currently really lightheaded after losing blood but i kinda like it",1580093362.0,1.0,1
I’ve officially just given up and I have a desire to screw my life up and make it as miserable as possible.,"18 M I used to be normal I guess. Then I got into a relationship and I was abused in every single way possible and forced to do sexual actions or she would go to the police. Saying I assaulted her. She destroyed my mind completely. I have zero trust in women and I’m fairly certain their all malicious on some way. Got out of it but a about 6 months after I’ve just been spiraling down hill. I used to be fit now I’m out of shape and have Chubb. I now hate myself and my body more than ever every second of every single day. Maybe she was right. I am a worthless, ugly, out of shape piece of shit. I deserved all the abuse I got and probably more. I have found absolutely nothing that interests me in life and I’m completely lost for my future. I refuse to take medications and therapy because I’m meant to suffer. I’m really good at hiding these things because I don’t want other people giving a shit because it’s not their damn business. I work at a dead end job washing dishes at a fucking Cracker Barrel. I have zero talents or skill sets. I’m literally useless and taking up resources.  No I don’t want to hear your bullshit cliches on just be happy or try to work on yourself and get help... fuck that. It’s weird but now I just want to see my life spiral down further and further and I want to suffer and make my life as miserable as possible it’s literally the only desire I have now. I have extreme social anxiety and it prevents me from doing most things.(not that I would anyway) I’m probably just gonna spend the rest of my hopefully soon numbered days just loathing and praying that I just get taken out quick somehow like in my sleep or something. I just don’t deserve the right to experience life and be happy. Thats permanently burned into my brain now. God I hate that I was born. I don’t want your pity or your cliches I just wanted to type how I feel every day so I can stay reminded Incase I forget.",1580093189.0,1.0,0

Just worried,My sister called pert and tried to have me put in the hospital for days. The reason for this is because i didn't tell her my problem which she has in the past told me if i am not comfortable i don't have to. She threatened me again with going to my dad who tells me to kill myself since no one would care. I was able to lie and say i was fine and they believed me which was good since i get worse rather than better. Now she said we are all having some talk when her husband gets here and now i am worried on what will be talked about since she has betrayed my trust many times talking about personal information to random people even. While she says we will talk its more like they will take their anger on me blame me for things i have no idea on and make me feel like it is my fault everything happens. Just a few more months so i can join this transitional youth adult programs i think that is what it is called and they will help me live alone away from all this screaming. Also my dad lives in mexico i has born here and have the papers to prove it just the threat is to send me there.,1580093010.0,1.0,0
My life is a lie,"I tell people that “I’m fine.” Even if I tell people how I feel, I almost never say the full extent. I never tell people that I am dissolving, and liquefying; morphing into a pool of nothingness. I never tell people how utterly hopeless I am, because I don’t want people to lose their own hope. I don’t want to lose my friends, but oddly enough, that makes it so that I don’t really let them be friends. Time has gone by at an eternally slow pace, and yet it can’t go any faster. I am both horrified that I will be old in what feels like tomorrow, and yet hope that I will die today. I’m a living paradox, and yet I am not truly alive. At least if I was alive, I would have a purpose.",1580092911.0,1.0,0

I've lost all connection with basically all of my friends. I never had any connection with my parents. I'm going to fail half of my classes. And the few reasons I had for not killing myself before seem to just be disappearing

My girlfriend left me 2 months ago and she was the only person I've ever felt like I could make a connection with. I used to not want to hurt my friends or parents with my death, but since I've lost connection with my friends, and learned that the relationship I thought I had with my parents didn't actually exist, I'm not too worried about hurting them anymore. And the last reason I had was that I thought things would get better with time, but I've been saying that for 3 years and things have only gotten worse since then

I usually try to hide my problems by surrounding myself with people Ik at my school but that doesn’t always work. When I’m home I’m always reminded about how much of a disappointment I am to my family, and how little people at my school really care about me, the only people who text me are thirsty boys and that’s about it.

I keep coming to the conclusion that I’m just unlovable... and apparently I’m not the only one who thinks so, everyone kept telling me my ex said he didn’t know how anyone could ever love me... before reminding himself that no one actually does... it’s funny cuz I wasn’t the one who broke us up. He was. And I didn’t do anything to him so idk why he’d say that.

I feel like I'm stuck in a shitty job and every day I contemplate just crashing my car or hoping I don't wake up the next morning so it'll end.,"I'm 29 years old. Still living at home. I don't make enough money to afford to move out. I've been applying for work since august of last year. I wound up in this job after being laid off as a result of my old company being bought. Every day I go to work to do soul sucking accounting excel bullshit. Every day I drive in constant traffic to an office infested with cock roaches to stare at excel spreadsheets doing thankless work with out of date systems. All around me I see people being able to afford houses, move into their apartments, work for good companies and I'm stuck at home. I feel like a failure to my parents, and my girlfriend. I feel like I'll never be good enough. It used to be that you couldnt get a job without experience. Well the last recruiter that I spoke to told me that even though I have experience they want someone with the degree. 

150 jobs since august. Multiple resume rewrites and constant rejections via email. No interviews. When I ask people for help I get nothing. Blank stares or ""idk why this advice isn't helping you. It's what everyone else does"". So far I've had 4 mental breakdowns in the parking lot from the stress. I faked being sick last thursday and Friday just so I didnt have to go in. At this point i almost want to get fired. Why even bother to keep going anymore. Why not just go to sleep and never wake up again?

I got diagnosed with ADHD last year in September.....I was so bitter...I still am. I lost jobs, got kicked out of college, kicked out of my house as a teen, ended up in foster care, all kinds of nonsense; thinking if I just tried harder I'd get it right...only to find out it was beyond my control this entire time....figures.

But then in September, I took Ritalin, it was like I lived my entire life as a hoarder and suddenly realized my house was full of junk. I stared to clean up; I started going to work on time, finishing my schoolwork on time...I got a 4.0 last semester! Its not that I was dumb, I always did my work; I just always forgot to turn it in....I felt like...finally...life is going right, I can do this at last... So, I decided to try for my dream and go to law school. I studied every day 4 hours a day, did my homework and went to work...I was finally going to have the life I wanted and to get here, all I needed was the right diagnoses to help me get it together. I spent years trying to get the answer and nothing worked...now I have it and I know things will be finally be okay. I am going great in school, I am knocking my LSAT prep out of the park....I went to Yale to figure out where to set the bar....they told m it was set just fine; I had a shot as good as anyone else. I was so happy...I got this! My debt is almost gone, I can afford my life, in March  2020, I'll have worked a job longer than a year for once in my life...This is good, I got this, finally.

I got fired January 3rd. My supervisor engaged in discrimination and I fought back. I lost. I got fired and given unemployment because they reasonably would rather keep him than me. I have proof, I got a lawyer, he agreed with me and wanted to sue. I was to meet him Monday morning to get things going. I woke up Monday and thought....what was the point? Why bother, I'll look like a sore loser, strong arming my way back into the workplace was not what I wanted to do...so I just laid on my couch and I haven't gotten up since.  I stopped taking my Ritalin. I stopped studying, I stopped doing my schoolwork....I got unemployment...I guess that should excite me but it doesn't. I am a failure....Once again; putting the burden of work on my husband, even though I am in a better position to earn a higher salary and he never picks up the slack regardless.... I am back where I started just a year go...on my couch...doing nothing....but I just cannot bring myself to feel anything. This time around. I don't want to try to get another job and work for another 8 months only to get fired again....This is how it always goes, get a job, lose it in 8 months, be on the brink of poverty once more....I'm tired of this....I did everything right this time and I still got fired, so why bother.

I'm exhausted from just....trying...all the time I am trying and I clearly cannot get my shit together....this was not supposed to happen. For once I did everything right....so how am I here...on my couch...just empty and disappointed in myself. How did I get here and why do I keep coming back?

I  committed myself to personal growth these last 3 years, classes on interpersonal relationships, organizational behavior,  conflict management...all to be better...but somehow, my outcomes are worse. The more I try to provide a better life for myself, the more I fail...and I'm tired of failing. I'm tired of losing jobs, academic opportunities, relationships and little bits of myself and my...happiness....I am tired of being unhappy and never experiencing stability....I  never felt like I was asking for much, but now, waking up each day is a curse and I hate it. Life is not rewarding and I am tired of looking for the silver-lining an coming up with nickels...So fuck it....its only a matter of time before I do this all over again; even if I make it into law school, I'll screw that up some how and not understand how I did it...that is my last dream for myself...I can't bear to watch it go up in smoke.",1580091214.0,1.0,1

Mom and dad leaving me behind because I didn't put on my shoes. Ridiculing me as a childn at parties or events centered around me because I would get overwhelmed and didn't want to take part in. Mom dragging me by the hair through the house like a doll, beating me with a belt till my legs bled. Friends, sports?, no, those required involment, here's the TV, figure it out. We move cities, teenage years, the beatings just get worse, I am bigger, I can handle harder, dad can punch me now, in the back, that pain I get when my back is strained from work, thank you dad for reminding me of you. Slaps, screaming, more hair pulling, name calling. - ""if I knew the kind of bitch you would've end up being I would've never dated you father"" -. Thank you mom I was only 12 but I will always remember this. Can't do math, my brain doesn't get it, I struggle, school is hard, I get my report cards threw at my face while hearing how much of an idiot I am, a disappointment, stupid. You were unfair and I wanted to get away, I locked myself in my room, no, you can't, dad punched a whole in the wall and opens it, he beats you up, I am 16, I still have the pictures of my beated up body in my computer, because I thought i could do something and I couldn't. Med school, you guys are proud of me now right?, less beatings, you talk good about me, I feel important, I made it, I have a job, you don't. Mom never worked, she was busy raising me and my sister, dad could never keep one for longer than a year. You need money for your rent?, but i live in a different city, sure, thays what good daughters do right?. You need more money? Yeah no problem, I will just eat ramen and boiled eggs this month. That's what a good daughter does right?. Making me prostitute myself online when I was 21 so you guys could take the money I made doing so is what good daughters do right?.

Would diary journaling help with depression memory loss?,"We all know that a symptom of depression/anxiety can be memory loss. It’s one of the most difficult things about depression because you lose your train of thought mid-sentence, it creates brain fog and you just can’t seem to think straight, it’s hard to talk about things that have happened in the past. I know I’m not the only one that suffers from this because depressed people mention it all the time.

I was thinking, would writing down your day be beneficial for your memory? Write every single little thing that’s happened, like I ate “blah blah” for breakfast, I said hello to Steven today, I played games for two hours today and then maybe read it before bed. Almost like a mindfulness exercise. 

I’d be happy to hear any ideas if anybody has any because I’m sick of not feeling like I’m present in the moment.",1580090812.0,1.0,1

Since I lost her my every day feels like a nightmare I can't wake up from.,"My whole life was pretty shitty. Stuff like being bullied, isolated, lonely, shamed of being poor, has left a rather deep, invisible at the first glance, scar. Ever since childhood I've been a weirdo. Kids just couldnt understand that I wore worn down clothes because I couldn't afford new ones. Hell, me and my 2 brothers often had to split a sweet bun(is it how you call these little, round breads with sweet filling in it? My english is still rather bad) in 3 because we couldn't afford more than one. 

The fact that my father was na alcoholic that spent 70% of the money on himself or alcohol didn't help out either. I still remember having our fridge empty for 90% of the time. He was also the cause of my first suicidal thoughts when I was 8. I wanted to kill myself and leave behind a letter, hoping that it will wake him up and he will stop drinking. Growing up wasn't much better either (although our financial situation got better and now we're a middle class). I had trouble talking to people and I kept distancing myself from others. My family also started fightig a lot and my parents were about to divorce. This was also the time when I tried to kill myself and failed. Things changed when I met my first girlfriend. 

I started opening up as a person, maturing a lot during the process. I got a bunch of friends and a loving girl. I didn't want to die anymore. I also managed to enter a very good highschool. It seemed as if my life started heading into the right direction. That was until she cheated on me a month after entering the new school. I was broken, but I forgave her. And that was a mistake. Few weeks later she cheated on me once again and left me for another guy. I also started losing my friends since we all went to different schools. The depression struck me again, causing me to lose 17kg in a few months. I tried to keep myself away from my own mind, going out with friends, getting into weird groups, alcohol and drugs. I pretty much went from a non-drinker into someone who drank large amounts of alcohol 4 times a week, being hangover at school all the time. It was also a time when my best friend broke contact with me because her BF was jealous. Just when I was about to take my second suicide attempt, I met a girl online. 

We quickly became friends and helped each other a lot. Thanks to her I quit drinking and smoking and took way less drugs. She pretty much became my soulmate. I've never been so close with anyone before. Our friendship continued for 3 years when we both confessed our feelings to each other and decided to meet for the first time (we live on the opposite sides of the country, 10h ride on a train). I went to her on the weekend (I couldn't possibly stay at her house as I was a total stranger for her family) and we rented a room in secret for 3 days. We spent amazing time together and gave each other our first times. I couldn't be any happier! We cried our eyes out while waiting for my train. I wanted to spend more time with her so I went with the last train. At around 11pm I arrived at the city I was supposed to have a bus from to my home only to find it was cancelled and the next one would be in 14h. I had a very important exam at 9am the next day, so I tried to catch a ride. No money, phone dead, unknown city and freezing weather. It started raining and the temperature was close to 0 degree celcius. I only had pants and a t-shirt on me, so after waiting a few hours outside all I could feel was cold and a huge pain from my limbs. But I wasn't upset or sad. I was thrilled! It was almost like a romantic novel. I finally managed to catch a ride at 5am. I somehow came these 200km from the city I was stuck in all the way to my school before my exam begun. When I got there I was still wet and almost fell asleep whenever I closed my eyes, but I still passed the exam. I had a flu for the next week, but it was well worth it. I started saving money to be able to meet her again asap. I lived in a rented room, so I was pretty short on cash. I cut down on my food and ate around 700-800kcal everyday, dropping around one kilo per week, but I couldn't complain. Thanks to that I was able to meet her every month. I even met her family and they liked me from the very beginning, treating me like I was their own son. I finally felt like I had a family. It was an awesome time. I loved her from the deepest part of my heart and she loved me! Whatever I considered love before, had lost all it's meaning when compared to what I felt for her. Life was the best. 

Time flew by, I graduated highschool and we were together for more than a year. I wanted to go to the college in her city. It was also when she started changing. We talked less and less and she had very little time for me. Before I knew it, she said she feels suffocated in our relationship and we should break up. I fell apart, but I didn't show it. I knew for some time now that she didn't feel it anymore and I didn't want to make it hard for her. A week later I found out that she started dating her friend who I ""didn't have to worry about"". It ruined me even more. I wasn't dumped only because she stopped loving me. I was dumped because I was worse than him. She broke up with him a few months later though. Still, getting abandoned by the only person who accepted me whole made me unable to lead a social life after that.

I went to college near my home town and rented a flat with some friends. It's almost a year since we broke up. I don't have any friends at college. Every conversation with someone causes me to feel tired, I start feeling like I haven't slept for a few days. I cry every single night, unable to stop thinking about her. I almost always have dreams in which she leaves me. I'm unable to live like a normal person. I have never felt as bad as I do now. I tied all loose ends by now and made most of the preparations for my final suicide attempt. I don't know how much longer I can endure. It all just seems pointless... I tried very hard, but I love her with all I've got and I can't live without her. I hit or hurt myself in various ways whenever I start feeling like I'm on the edge, but it stopped helping. I'm a mess. I want to live. I want to be happy and have a happy family. I want to make breakfast for my wife im the morning and take my kids to school. But I can't. I'm simply unable to achieve any of these things. I'm afraid I gave her all I had and I don't know how much longer I can endure...

I'll probably never date again.,"It has been years since I've been on a date, about a decade since I had a relationship. It doesn't usually bother me, it is so low on my list of issues that it doesn't even occur to me. I'm used to being alone at this point, I don't expect people to want me, I wouldn't want me.

That being said, I went through my old messages today and found out it has been half a year since I even got a reply on a dating website. Not from lack of trying, messaging the new faces on the varied dating websites is part of my daily routine. I've sent out thousands of messages, and not generic ""hellos"" ""hru"", I message them about something that piqued my interest on their profile. Or if nothing piqued my interest I at least try to open with a question about their life instead of a generic ""Hi"". I'm not just on one website either so it isn't like I was shadowbanned unless they collectively decided to ban me.

But no responses, at all. Not even a ""not interested"". Like, holy shit, talk to me before you reject me. You don't even know that I'm a broke loser with no car, no ambition, severe depressive issues and suicidal ideation, I'm not opening with that or putting that on my profile.

I don't have any passions for things I used to do or joy in things I liked anymore. Every day I wake up with the looming thought that one day, we are going to die, and I'm petrified of not knowing where the hell I am going to go, but at the same time am horrified of living on this shitty planet.

I don't want to exist just to perish from a random final destination circumstance or horrible luck or even old age. I don't want to die not knowing if I'm going to see black for the rest of my life or never exist and all of this time spent on this Earth is wasted.

But I think about all the people that have died. All the people that were lucky to escape and don't have to worry or fear this thought anymore. The people that have left this Earth and no longer exist not having to have the anxiety or shit that I have mentally that haunts me every waking moment now. I left the house to get groceries and cried thinking I would never see my family again and I would die in a crash. I'm 24.

I'm lazy and it's ruining my life,"I'm 20 and last year I quit college, started working, quit again. I don't do anything. My parents are getting fed up with me. And I tbh I hate myself for it as well. I don't feel depressed but I think I am if that makes sense. To me I don't feel that I'm worth it. I don't think I'm cut out for life and that scares me. I don't want to die but I do. I want to do therapy but even that I can't manage to make myself do. I don't want to accept help but I think I need it. I feel like the biggest failure. Stupid and lazy that I can't get up like I used to. I try not to think about the future, it scares me. Lately I'm not going outside and it's starting to have effect on me. People are making me nervous, like I can't breathe well or look them in the eye. I cut contact with all my friends. It's bad. Really bad. AND I don't know what is going with me. I wasn't like this and the strangest thing is when I don't think about my life, I'm totally fine but when I do. I'm just scared. I don't feel depressed though and that confuses me only when I think about my life I do.

I don't want to make my parents worry, they have been through shit their whole life and than here I am, trying to finish them by being the biggest disappointment. 

I'm the oldest one at home, my siblings are just kids. I'm scared I'm being a bad influence. That they have a good for nothing sister. If they turn out like me, I'll never forgive myself. Sometimes I think how it would be to die. I'll never suicide but I think about it objectively and that makes me sad. 

I do want to go back to school, I want to work again but I don't have the confidence that I can do this. And that makes me feel like a failure as well. This believe that I can't do anything is ruining me. 

I'm starting to believe that I am not cut out for life. I can't do things normal people do. I'm wishing I die young. I'm so awful for thinking this. 

There are definitely reasons why I became like this but they're nothing but excuses. 
One of them is that I'm a person with empathy, people can influence me. 
I have listened to people and their problems, I cried with them. Tried to help them and I cared too much for my own good. I did that for so long. Nobody ever has listened to me. Only one person did last year and I broke down, ever since I'm not the same. 

It's not the complete story but it basically is my situation right now. I'm not even sure I want advise, I just want to write it out. Not sure someone will read this but if you do, I hope you don't think I'm a bad person.

My day in the void,"Everything is miserable atm.  I try to spend time with my daughter whenever I can, but pretending to be a normal human all week at work, and functioning at least 50% of the time is exhausting, and I spend the weekend deadass on the couch.  Yesterday my daughter and I took the dog (family pet when we were a family) to get his rabies booster, then to go get his nails clipped and ears cleaned.  Then we took him home, went out to eat, and I took her back to her moms.  It was a good day.  Today I have fought tooth and nail to do anything.  I have a horrendus headache, and everything has pissed me off and gone wrong.  I'm trying to get back into my hobbies, and to make a lamp for my daughter's nightstand at her moms.  I suck plain and simple, but I enjoy it and it could end up worse.  I just gave up for the night and while I was piling my stuff up, I realized I was talking to myself like you would talk to a toddler having a tantrum, and it actually helped a little bit.  I miss having people with me a bit, having some security, not being worried 24/7 about when I will be evicted, where will I go and all the other shit.  I miss my meds.

Sick of Struggling,"I was a failure in middle school and high school. My first semester in college, I was actually interested in the courses and somehow managed to get a 4.0. Next semester, I was on track for an internship by the honor's department head. I was taking difficult classes but enjoying them all... Then my Crohn's surfaced. For 3 months, I suffered intense pain but still stuck to trying in college, I was still doing good. But even after I got my official diagnosis, it took only one professor to cause me to give up.

After just riding through college, I decided I didnt care about the grades. I started taking classes I enjoyed. And that's where I messed up. I could have graduated by now. Then another semester came where I started getting severe migraines. Failed almost all my classes again...

Then for majority of the second half of 2019, I was excessively sleepy. I eventually got diagnosed with Narcolepsy.

I had one semester of college left, but I decided to transfer to online school instead. I couldnt work on my school because I was asleep throughout the day. 

I studied so hard for computer science, yet I cant even land a stupid job in the field i wasted so many years studying.


I have to pay for my credit card bills but I cant even get a minimum wage job in New York City.

Over the past year, my mind has taken up a new hobby, that hobby is torturing me. Day after day, cringe memories are thrown at me, wherever and whenever. You know when there's no physical, but there is mental pain.like nails down a chalk board in mind all the time, they even cause me to speak out. The random 'ouch','f**k','s**t' exits my mouth every now and then , at worst I even call out 'someone please kill me'.Or I'll just rub head as if I hit it somewhere.

I don't know anymore, I've gone for therapy, I'm all active ,held together and a hard working human being. I have family and friends. And yet ...

Last week I felt true depression, I had never known it's true form, I was completely paralysed by my own mind.For 4 days, I could hardly get out of my bed. Only mustering up enough energy to eat and even that was difficult. I felt soo sick and yet I knew I wasn't, I knew what it was. I tried hard to fall sleep all the time, to run away but eventually I could not and so there I lay.Image after image, mental video after mental video. On repeat. Eventually, I suppose, I worked my way out of it. But, my mind still does what it does on repeat.

A few months ago I had to move back home because my girlfriend couldn't find a job and I couldn't afford to support both of us. My parents went away on a trip last week and as a result I went on a drinking binge and didn't show up to work on Thursday or Friday. I also relapsed and started smoking again for the first time in years. 

Today I was on a job board and saw an ad from my company for the same position that I work. Now I have a sick feeling in my gut, thinking I may not have a job after tomorrow.

What triggered your depression?,"Sometimes depression and anxiety are simply genetic without any known direct cause. In my case, depression and anxiety both run in my family but mine was “set off” by a toxic work environment. I have always struggled with self esteem and confidence since I was young. Without going into too much detail, my last boss was horrible to me. She went against district protocol to do whatever she wanted. She blamed me for things that had absolutely nothing to do with me and gaslighted me into believing it was my fault. I actually found out that this involved another person but she lied to blame it on me. She also micromanaged me to the point where I was having panic attacks. I resigned from that job and this happened two years ago but I still feel hurt by it. This woman’s treatment of me haunts me sometimes and I cannot fathom how someone could have such little regard for another person. She triggered my depression. I went from a woman who hardly ever cried to crying at the drop of a hat and wanting to die. I did recieve therapy and continue to take medication but it still hurts me. My confidence is a level zero and I want it back (what little I had). 

Can anyone else relate? What triggered your depression?",1580085991.0,1.0,9

"Partner is depressed, stopped having sex","My partner (26M) and I (28F) have been together for over 3 years, and have lived together for 2 years.

Our sex life was absolutely amazing (the best I've ever experienced!), but the frequency of sex has decreased dramatically over the last year and it's making me very disconnected and unwanted. Especially since this has happened before with my ex of 5 years (I ended due to the lack of sexual intimacy). I began to resent my ex because I was rejected so often (and other reasons). However, it's different with my current boyfriend because he is such a great person, I'm incredibly attracted to him and respect him very much. He has undeservingly been through a lot over the past couple of years. 

He suffered the loss of two very close family members late 2017 and early 2019, and has been dealing with some financial difficulties which has had a negative impact on his mental health. He has gained some weight as a result of comfort eating and working long hours. He also dislikes his job at the moment.

It all started a year ago, when I walked into the living room wearing just lingerie, stockings and heels, sat down, looked at him and started playing with myself. Usually this would send him wild, but he just looked awkward and stared at the TV. We spoke and he said he didn't feel in the mood, felt awkward, and that he just doesn't feel good about himself lately, like weight, etc. Still, he made the effort and we would probably have sex once a week.

Fast forward to December 2020. We hadn't had sex in 3 weeks, so I came onto him. But he didn't want it. We talked and he said he is depressed, overweight and hates his job. He said it had nothing to do with me, but his own issues. He said that he dreads having sex, and feels very stressed about initiating it, or when I initiate it. He just doesn't have a sex drive at the moment. He said that he wants to go to the doctors to see if he has a hormonal imbalance. I said that I would let him work through it with no pressure. 

Sex aside, we have a committed, loving and playful relationship. I am very happy with this man, and I genuinely want to be there for him through everything. Now it's been 2 months since we've done anything sexual, and I'm naturally feeling insecure, undesirable, disconnected. It's hard that I'm not able to talk about it. I also can't talk about it with a friend because I feel it's disrespectful. It hurts that I can't help him with his depression. And I wonder if our sex life can ever go back to the way it was (I miss it!). This is out of my control so I feel like Im just waiting and hoping for change. Please can you give me some hope or helpful advice.

I’ve noticed one of the biggest issues is my passive aggressiveness, sarcastic comments, and pokes for a fight. I’m an online gamer so most of my friends are online as irl I’m very anti social/socially anxious; so it’s ofc so easy to just type something with emotions running and not mean it.

The Reason I Keep Existing,"I feel horrible all the time. Nothing really makes me happy, and I hide in my room and just watch anime or play video games all day. Why am I still alive? That is a question I always ask myself. I started researching ways to kill myself effectively and painlessly secretly.

  But I'm not going to. I'm not going to die. My wish is for everyone around me to be happy. Helping people with their problems makes me smile, and if I have to suffer daily to help other people, then damn it, I'm going to!

 I know people who are going through lots of pain as well, and I try to help them, even if it's not very effective. I'd rather see other people smile because I'm there to crack a joke or trip and fall with comedic timing than have everyone weep because I did yet another thing to disappoint everyone in my life.

So I'll keep going, for my friends, and even people on the internet who know what I feel like every day. Thank you for giving me the will to live.",1580083503.0,0.81,34

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy having people trust me enough to tell me their problems; but it also makes me feel so alone because no one wants to listen to mine. 

I'm sorry, I just feel sad and alone. I know I need to stand up for my needs and stuff more; but how can I do that when people are hurting and need help and look towards me for that? I dont know anymore, my depression has gotten worse and I just feel like my only purpose is to help others while I'm slowly deteriorating on the inside with no one to help me.

The covenant is destroyed,"I [22F] spiraled, fall of last year. I got my diagnosis for the first time. Went to therapy for the first time. Took medication for the first time. But the darkness did not go away. I was involuntarily taken away to a hospital, for a week. 

The covenant were three (X, Y, and Z) of my friends who didn’t leave me when I pushed everyone—all my friends and family—away. They stayed. They visited me every day. And when I got out, they were there for me then. The new year, 2020, had promises of healing. The covenant was pure, honest, and true. It was my motivator, a testimony of my strength. 

But one by one, the covenant got destroyed. 

 X was my best friend, my anchor, and probably THE reason why I am still alive. But he led me on, and took advantage of me, despite fully being aware of my unstable, mentally ill state. Turns out, X had feelings for both me and Y, fucked Y, and basically led both of us on. I have not spoken to Y since the New Year. I feel humiliated, betrayed, and in so much pain. I never wanted to have feelings for my best friend, X, or get stuck in a stupid fucking love triangle, which will, inevitably, permanently tarnished my friendship with both. 

Z this past weekend, in a drunken stupor, told me he was distancing himself from me because he has had people close in his life in similar situations to mine, hurt him. I never wanted to be someone people had to preemptively distance themselves from because they didn’t want to get hurt.

Depression is finally gone but i do miss it,"Hello, ill try to keep it short. Ive had 3 pretty bad years. Was really depressed and suicidal. With the usual stuff too, self harming, drug abuse, suicide attempts etc. However, since like a month or so my 'problems' kinda dissapeared, they just vanished suddenly. Which is great, or that's what I thought. I was always hoping to get better during my tougher days. But now that I dont feel bad anymore life has changed so much. It has improved in some ways, I dont abuse drugs anymore, getting my life back together slowly, college is more bearable and all that. But now it just doesn't feel right. To be honest. I'd rather have all my problems back again. Life rn is good but it seems like a part of me is missing, a part that defined me and made me who I am today. I'm not saying I'd rather still cut or do other dumb things but I miss something. I know I should be happy now, but it feels like my life is 'boring' maybe? It actually feels more like my life is on auto pilot. Day in day out, life goes on and I'm not really aware of that I guess. 
It's like I'm not really living my life. I'm not sure, maybe it's supposed to be like this. It kinda lacks emotion and feelings.

Keeping friends at a distance emotionally,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

idk if this subreddit is the right subreddit but I need somewhere to get things off my chest.

&#x200B;

So the things is: I couldn't care less if my friends left me. Which is something pretty unhealthy, right? I hang out with my friends all the time but I don't feel that 'click', that 'emotional connectedness'. A few days ago a friend was upset that we hadn't spoken to eachother in a while and internally I was like: Yeah? So?   
The only reason I hang out with my friends is because I don't want them to feel like I've been a waste of their time. Another friend regularly asks me to eat together, I'm like: 'Okay, sure'. Then, I ask him to eat together not because I want to eat together but because I feel like I have to 'return the favor'.

I feel like I can't connect with my friends at a deeper level. I think I do this to protect myself from getting hurt when they leave.

I feel like none of my friends are *really* my friends. I just hang out with them and later I'll meet others that I'll hang out with and they'll replace my old friends. I have this even with friends that I've known for 8 years and for 4 years. I feel like im putting up a facade.

&#x200B;

The other thing is: in relationships, I *can* form this deeper connection. However, that makes me get jealous really quickly. When my so at the time hung out with another guy I immediately thought she was going to cheat. Other things I do is passive-agressively let her know something is wrong with me. Which is annoying because something is wrong with me pretty quickly (for example: me getting jealous).

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm not an emotional healthy guy to be around. I have lots of friends and I've been told by many people they can't think of a reason why people would not like me. But boi can I think of some reasons. Don't get too close to me because I'll be toxic to you.

Happiness is temporary and my depression will never go away,"Let's face the facts. No matter what I change or achieve in life... It might make me happier but only temporary. Then I will fall back into depression again, it was always like this. I am afraid that when I did and achieved everything in life I always wished, I might become content for a while but then become depressed again after a few days. Everything is just an illusion. When you are deep into depression and are suicidal, things like healthy food, vitamin d, sports, surgery, career, money, friends and adventure won't cure your depression. They might make it better than when you do the opposite of these things but they won't cure you. All you can do is learn to cope with it.

And I hate it when people that don't suffer from depression give me advice and say that it is bc I am not trying hard enough or I will be cured by doing these things.",1580081210.0,0.93,3

Longtime lurker (new account) first time writer.,"So, I’ve been on reddit a while under various accounts and I’ve always come back to this sub because it helped me feel less alone. Well lately I (29f) have been rocked to the core with shit out of my contro, maybe it was under my control and I’m trying to find something to blame, I couldn’t honestly tell you. I’ve been feeling like my life is not mine anymore and I have basically became a statistic overnight. I’ve found myself living back at my parents house after living over 1,200 miles away, unemployed, got out of an abusive relationship that landed me in the hospital and jail (because he called the cops and told them I was trespassing), and no money. It was kind of a catalyst when the relationship fell apart, he wasn’t always physically abusive but definitely did things that were scary and unsolicited. It got physical after he broke up with me at which point I felt pressured to call the police. It wasn’t what I truly wanted to do but I also didn’t think he would retaliate so viciously. Because of the pending charge I find myself needing to explain my record to jobs that do background checks and because I got fired from the job because of what happened I’ve lost complete hope in almost everything. Now, almost 4 months later I am quickly turning all the hope I did have to suicidal thoughts, (like life is miserable how could i have been so excited for this?). I can’t write the words goodbye because I still think that it’s going to get better but every roadblock has me questioning even that. My reasons for not doing it are going away because even the relationship with my parents is truly suffering.

My misery stems from being ugly/unattractive : BDD,"I am miserable and depressed because I am ugly. It is simple as that. When I say ugly, I don't mean it in terms of mere ugly to beautiful spectrum. I am unattractive because I am strange looking. I'm abnormally assymetrical, my skin is saggy, I have a boulder face, the list goes on and on. I am so frustrated because I am aware that appearance is not everything and that I'm wasting so much time, so much of this existence obsessing over something so superficial. Our current society makes us believe that appearance play a big part in determining self-worth and value, but I acknowledge that this is due to toxic lookism and that there are far more important aspects of life that I need to prioritize over. Even so, I can't even live by my words or beliefs, because I'm already taken over by my bdd. Prior to doing anything to advance in life, I feel like I need to change the way I look so that I can look like an average, ordinary person. The way I can describe this feeling is like having to constantly try and fulfill the prerequisites that others already have in life, so Its just like an endless cycle of self-hate and hopelessness. Every footstep is so delayed, I never move on forward. I'm always battling with myself on the inside, and I have no energy or will to face real life. Everything just seems so meaningless. It's become a daily routine to ask myself whether or not I should die today. I will never be able to live an average life. I will never have a stable mind or body.

How to start this...,"I haven’t been so low since I was 18 and I am not handling it well. I found myself standing in the shower the other day, crying and saying to myself “You should just die, I wish I could just say” without really thinking and then surprising my self by knowing that I actually meant what I said. 

I feel anxious all the time and I am not sure what is causing it. I feel like crying all. of. the. time.

I was fired from my job in August. I felt awful there so it wasn’t so terrible. I thought that I had fallen in love but he’s manipulative and lies about the most basic things. Apparently he was in a relationship when he got with me. I haven’t had the best love life, been cheated on a lot and I feel stuck in this and that I can’t get out. Every time I try to break things off he somehow convinces me not to and I end up hating myself  even more afterwards. He’s not a bad man... but I don’t know, it’s hard to explain.

I feel so lost. I feel like the best thing would be to die. That way I can’t be burden anymore. I am 30 years old and I still need financial help from my parents. I have debts that I can’t for the life of me pay off. It’s a vicious cycle. I have no friends. I have pushed them away by being difficult. I have no one to talk to about my problems. I feel like a horrible person who takes horrible decisions. Selfish. So ... so selfish. I think I am trying my best but I am not sure that’s actually true. Liar and an asshole. How did this happen? I used to be such a sweet girl who cried when she lied. Which is maybe a little extreme but I used to be very sensitive. And am still, but not about lying. I wish I wasn’t this sensitive.

Can't open up,"My friends keep reminding me that I can message them any time if I'm feeling sad so they can talk to me about it, but deep down I know that I just can't.

There are one or two people I can actually open up to, but even then I just get scared that I'll eventually drive them away, or they'll get fed up of hearing about my problems. Even though it's much harder dealing with things by myself, to me it's better than dumping all of my issues onto another person. 

I want to be happy - just feeling good or even alright the majority of the time would be enough for me. I'm actively trying to get outside, and take care of myself by getting dressed, showering, and cooking proper meals, but some days it feels like a lot of effort just getting one of those things done. Some days I don't do any of those things, but it's never because I'm too lazy. It's because I don't have the physical and/or the mental energy to do so. It makes me feel so weak and pathetic when getting out of bed feels like a chore. 

I feel like I have to complete a mental checklist before I can think about talking to someone about how I feel. When people have found out I haven't gone outside yet, or had a shower, they assume that once I get those things done, I'll instantly feel better. While I understand where they're coming from (outside means fresher air, showering means you don't feel gross), it usually doesn't make any difference. To be honest, it makes it harder to open up to people when I feel like I have to have done certain things before I can reach out. 

I don't know if anybody else feels this way, but whenever I take that step and reach out, in the end I end up feeling like I take another two steps backwards. Once I open up and talk about my struggles, there's always this overwhelming sense of regret that comes afterwards. Even if I feel terrible and I desperately want to tell someone and ask for help, it always feels like there is something actively stopping me, and I hate it so much.",1580080360.0,1.0,0

Today I woke up, cried for an hour, watched some funny videos to pick my spirits up. Force fed myself some eggs, got sick from eating without an appetite, got sick some more from anxiety. Force fed myself some chicken in the afternoon and again in the evening just to keep my body running. Spent the whole day in bed, sent my ex a pathetic video, cried for an hour, apologized for the video and cried some more. This is my regular routine. (First time sending a video)

You dont have to be ugly, fat, socially awkward or humourless to be depressed. People from all shapes, sizes and backgrounds go through this. If you're suffering from depression and wishing you were better looking or taller or thinner, stop. It doesn't make it easier. It's mental, in your brain and that makes you hate yourself and wish you were different. No matter what I do for myself or how many girls are interested, i still feel disgusting and unwanted. I hate my depression, I refuse to hate myself because of it.",1580079386.0,0.85,3

Here goes...,"Never thought I'd be posting this but here goes. I'm a 23 year old male.

My life has never gone very well. As a child I was always very shy and a bit socially unaware. Never had many friends in school and was alone most of the time. My grades in elementary school were good but then came middle school and high school.

I think my depression started in middle school. I always felt very different from all the other kids. I was not good at sports or really anything for that matter. I started putting on weight and am not very attractive to begin with. Always alone usually. I was bullied alot as well.

It got so bad that by junior year in high school id play sick and just refuse to go to school. I couldnt take it anymore. Eventually just full on dropped out of high school.

Fast foward. Here I am at age 23 almost 24. Still living at home, have a shit job, and zero friends still.

I lost 2 people to suicide last year. One was a childhood friend the other an online friend. Both shot themselves. It messed me up pretty good.

Being alone for all these years is just to hard. I don't think I can take it anymore. Every year gets worse and worse and everyday i just get even more fucked up. I'm zapped of all emotions to the point i can't even cry anymore. I drink heavily every night and smoke a ton of weed to try to escape my sad existence.

Thank you for listening to me rant reddit.",1580078837.0,0.79,1

Your passing gives me strength, I feel more compelled to fight for my own freedom and happiness. Your passing helps me remember that life is short and worthless, therefore allowing me to realize what is important to me in the grand scheme, and none of this stuff matters if it only causes me pain and suffering. They talk about school like it's the next big thing, the key to my future, academics and opportunities being stressed upon, but is it truly happiness if it takes away those things that feed my soul? If it eats at my soul and make a monster out of me? I'm done trying to chase the light and fake my way through. I will not hesitate to strike down anyone who threatens this dream of mine, whether it be a friend, my family, my own children, or even someone I consider to be a brother. I will give everything to fulfill my dream of running away, erasing my memory from everyone I ever knew, and starting a new life where I can support myself and do the things I love. A life where school, friends, family, don't have to irritate me. A life where I can make new friends and find people I truly consider my family. A life where I don't have to lose all the time.

Scared to try anything,"One of my biggest worries is trying to find some kind of work-from-home job. I’ve tried different things in the past like selling baked goods at the farmers market, trying to sell stuff at the craft fairs, etc. and they were always epic failures. Lately I’ve thought about maybe taking on some housecleaning jobs for people, but I’m scared that I’ll fail at that too. Either nobody will hire me in the first place, or people won’t like the way I clean and then they’ll never hire me again.

I don’t feel like telling any of my family about my goals because they won’t support it. It’s like they know what an epic POS I am and so they don’t think I should even bother with it. My mother would probably say “no” because she would worry some pervert would hire me and then try to rape me, but I’m too ugly to get raped so there’s no need for concern over that.

That Special Feeling,"You know what sucks?  A week - quite literally a week - spent lying in bed.  The only exception, of course, being the one or two nights where I left the house to go drink at the local bar.  Today is day one of escaping ""the slump,"" as I've started calling it, and to be honest, it started out alright.  I took a nice long walk to my favorite local café, had a couple of coffees, did some job application work, and even grabbed a drink with my barista friend.  Then, feeling motivated and honestly pumped up, I came home to record vocals for a YouTube cover I am trying to create which is, honestly, well overdue.  

&#x200B;

And, of course, my fucking voice decided to throw out a nice 'ole ""fuck you"" and not work.  Okay, one option down.  Why not instead try and work on my personal statement for readmission to college.  Wait, nope, big 'ole brain don't wanna work either.  Maybe more job applications?  How about the fact that so many of these sales jobs you're applying to are solely commission based?  Fuck me, amiright?

&#x200B;

So now I'm here, empty minded, getting a little bit down, and trying to fight three urges:

1. Going out and spending money I don't have on drinks with a friend.
2. Hopping on the old PS4 and wasting my time away on video games for the night (which, let's face it, just leave me feeling empty in the end).
3. Sleeping.  Or rather, turning on the TV, laying on my lazy ass, and pretending to sleep.  

&#x200B;

I don't know what there is to do.  I don't know what makes me happy.  I don't know how to reach the goals and complete the projects I have laid down for myself; shit, I don't even know if completing those projects will make me feel any semblance of joy.  Right now, life feels empty, and I feel mentally dead.  I want to do something to make myself feel both alive and productive because I don't want this to be the start of another week long slump where I literally cannot get out of bed and have very little/no will to live.  So here I am, on reddit, making a post because I like writing but don't know what to write about, and I'm partially trying to get the creative juices flowing, partially trying to find some goddamned human connection, because fuck, dude, I'm lonely.  Essentially, I'm screaming out into the void.  For what, I don't know.  To who, I also don't know.  Yes, I know, drama queen of the decade here.  Sue me why don't ya.  You won't get much.

&#x200B;

I guess that's about it.  Also, I'm new here, so hi.  Name's Tomas.  I swear, there's more to this story, but I'll probably save that for another day where I can write a weeeeee bit more eloquently.

I cant resist anymore,"Im 18 and live in Brazil.

Everything that I wanna do ends fucked up in some way.

When i Was 6 I was raped by my nanny. My mom started to date a lot of guys so she didn't spend time with me or anybody in that house. I had to get through it alone at 6 years old. My paresr got divorced when I was 3 months ( my grandma told me that history)

When I was 9, I founded that my mom was a drug addict. I saw she doing with one of her boyfriend.  
It was ....

I had to move to live with my another grandma( mother of my father). Their live in different cities. So it was a nice start to a boy who was 14. Leaving my mom behind it was easy, cause she never spent that ' time ' w/ me. But it was hard to leave a 14 years of friendship and others things.

It was a nice beginning, but when I was 15 it got hard.
I started to think on things that were different from my age. 

When I was 16, my mom gave me a sister ( she is 3 rn)  and that changed my whole life, cause I was having suicidal thoughts in that time... so my sis changed that.

Fuck this history... I just don't know what I'm doing and what I need. I  cutted my wrist one time,  but I didn't die
That was embarrassing

No one found it out, about my cuts

I'm ok with the pain, it didn't border me anymore, 

I don't know why I never tried to give up about that things

I made a question to me:

You are gonna die in two minutes. But everytime that you breathe, you restart the chronometer.

A) breathe

B) stop the chronometer

Depression sucks but I don't wanna be treated differently. Is it wrong for me to want them to say that I don't want them to be sorry about how I feel and how I don't deserve it, I just wanna be left in peace and to not have to deal with all of this smothering, I get it's because they care but it's too much.",1580077923.0,0.94,6
Trying To Help- Checklist,"First off If you’re suffering with mental illnesses, I’m sorry, no one deserves to feel that way. This is a short checklist to make sure some of your human needs are filled out. Obviously everybody’s situation is different, and I understand that, but these things may help:

1-Diet, just in general get your diet in shape, try to make sure you are getting enough fruit and vegetables. Sometimes you may have a nutrient deficiency, I recommend taking a probiotic to keep your gut bacteria in check, and vitamin D3, especially in winter (This helps me a lot in the winter, a generally formula is 1000ui’s of Vitamin D3 per 25lbs, but don’ exceed 5000ui’s)

2-Exercise, This will help you feel better, trust me even if you don’t feel like doing it, You should.

3-Sleep, Get your 8 hours consecutively. This helps significantly 

4- Social life, Be social- this is a big one, I know it is much easier said than done, but it is completely essential. 

5- Meditate, I cannot recommend this enough, it will help you be more connected to people, decrease anxiety, and has increased my overall quality of life. All it takes is 10-15 minutes a day. Meditate

6- Have a meaning, Set goals for yourself, give yourself a reason to get up in the morning, this will be easier with the meditation

Extra tip: Jordan Peterson has some good content on this, he is adamant about having a structured day, and setting goals.

Best of luck!",1580077768.0,0.67,0

I'm convinced I'll die because of lung cancer,"I was smoking 15 cigarettes and 5+ spliffs per day for nearly a decade. On top of that I didn't eat fruits, vegetables and other healthy food. My diet was literally just some brown bread, pizza, hamburgers, fried chicken, sushi, wok meals, candy and soda. I was underweight too. 

It took me until I was 27 (!!!) to figure out that I should eat only natural foods like nuts, fish, fibre, veggies, fruits and so on. I'm doing that right now and gaining weight. I want to have a long life, but let's be real. By only eating garbage and inhaling a shit ton of toxic smoke, I'm already completely screwed. You are what you eat they say, well, I didn't eat anything nutritious and smoked like a chimney. There's no way I'll survive this.

This depresses me so fucking much. I know I'll start coughing up blood sooner than later. Then I'll die a miserable death within one year of my stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis. There's not much I can do to stop it. The DNA damage has already been made. It took me too long to figure out how life will be better when you're focused on your longevity. My childhood was traumatic with both my parents dying so I was just focused on dealing with that and being happy in the moment. That attitude will cost me my life. Awesome.

Suicide pact with myself,"Without going into too many details my childhood was awful, about two steps up from a child called it. So after multiple mental breakdowns and self harming I promised myself at about 13/14 that I wouldn't kill myself until I turned 30. My rational being that those who've had power over me wouldn't by 30 and I would finally be free and happy and if not... why drag my miserable life on..

The problem is that I've created a very high stakes life for myself where every failure, mistake etc. brings me closer to suicide. And since I'm not progressing as I believe I should the time where I kill myself seems inevitable.

So I'm 23 now and pretty much finished college with the exception of one math class I need. I've failed statistics at least 3 times and decided to take calculus instead, those being my only options for my major. And guess what I failed calculus too.I actually had a breakdown in the testing room and cried over the test for 2 hours until i was allowed to be dismissed. While ""logically"" I know that failing once doesn't make you a failure per se but I can't help but to associate the two. 

I don't necessarily want to die. Ideally I want to be free from this shitty family and live a life of freedom like I always wanted. But I can't this pact i made with myself has taken control of my life and I feel powerless. I don't know what to do anymore.",1580074908.0,1.0,2

The date went horrible for me since I was shy and uninterested(as rude as it sounds) but he liked it I guess.

Now the problem is, I just started ghosting the guy. I have no idea why I’m so stupid but I just hoped he will forget about me and I can go back to my  isolated, depressed life.

I know something is wrong.,"I know something is wrong.  My mind is a mess, my days are a haze, and my brain is numb.  I want nothing more than to curl up in a ball and cry.  My plans for my future, both near and far, are put on full stop.  I don't even have the strength to hold myself up.  I want nothing more than to lock myself away, never to be seen again.

Is this depression?  Can I even call it that?

All my life, I've told myself I'm nothing but a monster.  What kind of person makes their mother cry on purpose?  Who writes their mother letters on running away or calling them a hippo... on Mother's Day?  Who sits in a comfortable life and complains about how amazing they have it?  Only an ungrateful monster... That's who.

I went from monster to empty puppet.  I did what I was told, even if I talked back.  I had no control.  I had no freedom.  I felt voiceless, tethered to these strings, unable to break free.  Only to be told that I placed them there myself.  I was the one who tied those knots, yet how come I cannot break free?  Why can't I set myself free?

From puppet to caged bird, I never saw the light of day.  I shy away from the thought of leaving my safe place.  The only place that made me happy, the only place that I could trust.  I hide under hundreds of blankets, hoping to keep the thoughts at bay.  I drown myself in useless hobbies, in hopes to quiet my mind.  

Just as I had tied the knots of my strings, I locked the cage and threw away the key.  A monster deserves to be kept in a cage.  Something so horrible and heartless shouldn't be able to exist among human kind.  Yet, I fear death.  Not once has self-harm been the answer.  I have no scars from pain I've afflicted.  I've never tempted Death by holding his scythe to my neck.  Call it a ray of hope or a fighting spirit, but all I see is another type of coward.  Death without dying.  A life without living...  An empty shell in the corner of the cage with a blank face.

I did this to myself.  It's a battle I've fought for years.  One I've always thwarted off.  Why is it now that it overpowers me?  When have I become so weak.  I've placed myself in a cage for heaven's sake!  Why must you beat me down while you're at it?  All I want is to stop the thoughts.  I want nothing more to do with the words floating in my mind.

*You hurt everyone you meet.  You're the toxic one, not them.  Even now, you're hurting the ones you love as we speak.  Monster... Monster... Monster!*

I don't want to be the monster anymore!  I want to change!  But where do I start?  Where do I begin?  Is there a way to clean up this mess that I'm in?  My mind races more, and I can't keep the tears away.  I feel my head splitting, and I want it to go away.  Keep it together.  You're almost there.  Keep it together.  Your friends are here.

*Friends... Support...*

They give me love I do not deserve.  I wish to give them everything I can, but a heart that cannot love... What can I give?  Money?  Time?  A false sense of friendship?  I'd only be hurting them more.  All I give is pain.  Even if I ripped out my heart and gave it to them, would it even matter?  A heart as black as mine isn't worth a dime.

I know all that I'm doing is throwing a pity party for myself.  I know I can fix this with simple answers.  Exercise, eating right, and socializing...  I do all those things.  I go to school, I study, and I even take hikes.  I go to the gym nearly every day.  I eat healthy, despite the odd sweet here and there.  I have friends who love me and truly care.

*So where did I go wrong?*

I want out of my head.  I want out of my bed.  I want the strength to move on.  But all I get is a bag of regret, and a bag of guilt piled on.  My mom tells me to get out of my head, but how can I when just looking at her face sends me back to that place...  I never look her in the eye.

She loves me, I know.  She cares for me too.  I try to be grateful for staying under her roof.  But I've only done her wrong, and I've only caused her pain.  How can I be happy when that guilt still remains?  I remember the years of pain I have caused...  And now I can't seem to get over this pause.  A pause on life, a pause on living.  

I'm not sure what to call this.  Be it depression, self-pity, or other.  All I know is that something is wrong.  Something is wrong, and I have no way to fix it.",1580074107.0,1.0,0

Completely lost any kind of motivation.,"Hello, today i spent the whole day doing nothing but thinking.

3 years ago i had decided i wanted to commit suicide: i was pretty young, emotive and sensible. I often felt awkward and lonely because i had low social skills and low self esteem. My family wasn't really in a good place when i was in my childhood, my mother used to be very controlling and emotionally instable, and my father used to be very angry, absent, frustrated and he would always make me feel ashamed of myself.

The family thingy is better now, but i still can't be really affectionate with them, and sometimes i feel bad for that, but maybe time will heal.

Now, i obviously did not commit to my plan.. i had planned it, like that i would do it the day before school started again after summer, but when the they came i spent the day thinking, such as today.

I imagined that instead of killing myself, which i could theoretically do at any time, i could just live my life as it came, consuming every last bit of good things i had remaining, becoming detached from everyone and everything. Which i did..

And here i find myself again, having done huge steps forward for the betterment of myself and my life, i exercise, i like eating healthy, i try painting sometimes, and i like helping / teaching stuff to friends.. because now i have some friends! 

School is going kinda bad, or i mean it was going good just enough for me to pass all classes, it is really urgent for me to get to study again, but motivation is really lacking because i stopped caring and i am in doubt about my future as a computer science boi.

But well, you see, at least in the end i experimented much more that i could think of at the time, i developed passions for stuff life psychology and politics, i can talk to girls and have a nice convo with anyone, so i can finally consider myself 'respectable', in my own therms.

Idk this post was initially a lil cry for help, but kinda morphed into a progress story ahah, so yeah stuff happens if you keep going and know that there is plenty of people that deal with this and wants to help/be helped. I do a little bit of both :)",1580073914.0,0.67,0

Everything that goes wrong, they blame on each other or on me and my sister. They demonize each other all the time, unable to look at themselves. It has not always been this way, yet none of them feel like changing anything about themselves for reasons such as ""I'm too old, when you'll be my age you'll understand"" or ""It's too late for me"", and every effort I make to change for the better is always overlooked or diminished. They're completely oblivious to their flaws, yet they judge and gossip about everyone around them. That's the saddest part about it.

Really weird story of my life.,"Hey guys this is my first post and English is not my first language so please pardon any mistakes and don’t judge me please.

Background:-
I live in 3rd world country so the earning opportunities are not like usa, uk ,canada etc

I’m 17 male , all of my school life i never felt the connection and always felt out of place and i stayed lonely also but in 2013 my uncle insisted that i change school and get into a good school which he paid for since we couldn’t afford it. 

So when i got into that school I immediately felt that connection and i knew I should have been here earlier and now i always want to be here because i made good friends, like they genuinely cared for me, didn’t degraded me and i became the centre of attention pretty quick. We made so much memories together. We were the coolest kids in school.

 But deep down i knew it wasn’t going to last because of our financial conditions because my uncle (fathers’ brother) refused to pay mine and my brothers’ fees. But my father who was in uk at that time managed to somehow somehow makes ends barely meet. So that continued for 2 years. 

Then i got flunked (failed) because I didn’t study much which is because of our domestic issues (financial,my grandmom fighting with my mom etc) so i thought i should now go back to any  school (which was cheap) because of the financial situations because my dad was coming back home and there wasn’t any other source of income for us. I still remember and regret vividly that day when my dad came back, my two friends came to my house to convince me to not leave school and they said you won’t enjoy anywhere else and so forth.

 It’s been almost 5 years and that was the last time i met them. I still see all my friends circle on Facebook smiling and enjoying their lives to the fullest (like literally) I still want to hangout with them. I swear they come in my dreams 😂 because i think of them so often.
My college(12th grade) is going to finish this year and believe me that 2 years in that school were the best years of my life.

The friends that i have now are just fake and always want to let me down, degrade me somehow. I had to go the schools i hated going to for 5 years. Wasted so much time now that My school life is over I won’t get that back even if we got financially stable. Idk what should i do? I get very sad when i see them enjoying (not jealous i love them) will it get better? My head gets really heavy with these thoughts its 2 am while I’m writing this. I just feel that they all got going in life and i am just back there standing like an idiot who couldn’t get over it. I feel like i wasted the most important part of my life.",1580072898.0,0.67,0

will hoping to die daily will ever stop? or am I just wired like that,"17M. French, sorry for bad grammar.

I remember me at 8 years old, searching for a way to hang myself. Of course, I couldn't and wouldn't have done it. I just fantasized about it.

Six years later, a friend committed suicide ; as you could imagine everyone in my (what is the thing before high-school?) was talking about it we were getting help if we wanted.

Two years later, my dad, my sister and I witnessed my mom trying to kill herself with a knife and some meds after being depressed for 5 years and even after  staying for multiple months in a psychiatric hospital.

I was a very emotional kid, and of course my parents wanted me to see a psychiatrist. I never really did. 

Fast forward today, life is pain : but only by phases. Some times I don't think about it for a week, sometimes I think about it every hour. And that's what destroys me more : I can do all the efforts I want, it doesn't help, I will fantasize about dying on day or the other. And every time I was hoping I was good enough, I fuck something up and it's hurts a little harder. I can't handle it.  

If at this point you're asking yourself ""ok, so what about killing yourself already? "", there's the catch. I won't, not before  my familly forget about me : I hate my mother for trying to kill herself, and I won't do thar to my sister and my father that I love. 

So here, I'm condemned to suffer and just hoping to die in a tragic accident. And frankly, I hate it.

My mother is a mediocre human being. Am I going to  be like her? My brain won't let me alone.

Whoever reads this, I'm sorry for taking your time, I need help.

Off the Reservation,"Was doing really well.

After loads of family commitments from November leading up through the holidays, I could hardly wait to turn the page of the new year.

2020 started out awesome and I did it. Cut out alcohol, put myself on a diet, cut down on cigs, stopped my xanax.  Tried to rebuild structure and passion for my work.

Last week the whole thing fell apart and now I feel like a puddle on the floor.

Started having stupid arguments with my wife and that is not fun. My emotions were/are all over the place. Suicidal thoughts. My wife tried to initiate sex. The sensory overload was overwhelming. I killed the mood bringing up hanging myself with a rope.

Needless to say she was not amused.

Ended up getting the helll out and checked myself into a hotel on Friday to avoid any further conflicts and do some self-reflection. 

It was supposed to be for one of two days but still here  and just extended my stay for three more nights.

Have two meetings with my pdocs on Tuesday, psych and therapist.

Obviously my wife is concerned and so am I. Not fun for me or them to put myself in isolation. Thankfully she is being very supportive.

I was very stable in 2019. Really shocked how 2020 started amazing and now I am at my worst point in years all of a sudden.

Obvious thing is tried to do too much too fast. Stopping my xanax was a stupid idea ofc.

I re-engaged the xanax, but not helping. Now drinking again as well and being generally self-abusive all round.

Hopefully this is a blip.

Idk,"I just want to take my pain away. Everyday I am on edge. My mind is deficient and does not work properly. It does not function normally. My thoughts are scattered and frantic and any moment of peace I have is soon shattered by the feeling of dread, shame and anxiety. I am not smart. Halfway through my first year as an English and Film student, I have come to realize that I failed in education as a human being. I could’ve been intelligent, bright and forward-thinking. I could’ve been interested in mathematics, computing, science - Instead, I’m crawling through a course that was my only option available based on secondary school results and I’m struggling though pointless essays to get a degree that will provide me with no practical career opportunities. There is nothing else about me that makes up for that. I have no friends. I lost the very few that I had. I have no interests in anything. I have no hobbies, no passion for anything except eating food and laying in bed listening to music. I am incredibly ugly. My body was not constructed right. I have distinct flaws which are not debatable. They are objectively wrong and ugly. My body is weak, fat and cannot function normally. My boyfriend is everything I want to be. He possess every positive quality that I dream of; beauty, talent, intelligence, power, and more. I know that he will grow sick of me sooner rather than later and see through his rose colored glasses. He’ll see the mess that I am, and then finally, I will be completely alone with nothing, no feeling of support or stability or hopes or dreams, to cling to.

turning frustration into motivation,"I've suffered from depression before, when I was around 14 to 18 I think. Now I'm 27 and all I suffer from is this damned lack of energy. I'm not suicidal, thankfully, I don't have more self-doubt than is justified, and I'm not sad. Almost never. I just don't get anything done at all. Doing the dishes is a task like climbing a mountain.

Usually I just resign in front of all the things I should do and don't get done. But for a minute today, I got frustrated. Meaning: I stood up, shouted a little, really talked myself down on what a miserable failure I am - I think I was aggressive. And I started doing things. Nothing major, just ate - because I forget to eat.

But is it possible, if need be, to get myself into a pseudo-aggressive mood, and turn that energy into the energy to do tasks that need to be done?

No judgement towards him as this is more of a self reflection on myself but he suffers from health anxiety and is terrified to die and hates how he's getting older as it's closer and closer to death. 

But that stuff has never bothered me or even crossed my mind? The only reason I wouldn't enjoy being older is the growing amount of responsibilities I get. 

But when I think about getting old I sort of feel like it's not coming soon enough? Everyone talks about how fast time goes but it goes painfully slow for me and I wish it would speed up already so I could just pass away. 

This isn't even the feelings of suicide as I can be genuinely happy with my current situation and lately I have had a handful of good days but this feeling still sticks with me. 

I've been diagnosed with depression so that's most likely the reasoning to this it's just that I'm turning 19 and the most focused I am on my future is when I'll die, I don't think I could ever commit as it would be me destroying my familys hearts so I totally depend on fate taking its course.

Depression and relationship,"Hey everyone,

I have been in a wonderful relationship for almost a year now. She's my soulmate and I couldn't think of a better partner. But as soon as fall begins, I tend to get depressive episodes more often. She's ok with that and is able to deal with it in general. But here's my problem. When I feel depressed, I get super distant and isolate myself. This means, I don't talk, I struggle to be loving, I'd rather be alone and tell her to leave. In my depressive mood telling her to leave seems legitimate. But when I do this she's absolutely not ok with it. She tells me that she wants to stay and be there for me. But shutting her off seems the most ""rational"" thing for me at this point. After my episode I regret this behavior and am super sorry, but I can't help myself. When being depressive I completely change my behavior towards her and cut any emotional connection to her. I mean I want her to be there for me in the dark times, but something hinders me to let it happen.

Do you have any advice for me? Is this a normal behavior? What could I do to comfort her? How should I behave as soon as I stop to be loving, emotional, etc.

I'm also from a poor family in a 3rd world piece of shit country (currently under a revolution) that has mental health as a millenial myth, the neverending stress and failure, the eternal ""I'll make it this time"" only to fail again has me... Totally defeated. I also have a very good hearing, a bloody curse that hasn't allowed me to sleep, victim to noisy neighboors for at least 14 years now, and counting.

shortish story,"this doesn't really bother me, but i think about it a lot and thought i would share just because. maybe part of me wants to tell this story so there's proof it happened. 

this happened around a few months ago, sometime after reaching out to my parents about my mental illnesses and stuff. my mom came to pick me up from school, and when i got in the car, she told me she had been talking to my therapist about how i had been feeling lately and they were both worried and wanted to make sure i was ""safe."" i started crying and telling her i was fine, and i was, but she was still worried. i don't remember what the next part of the conversation was, i probably said something along the lines of ""i've made it on my own for years without your help, i know when i'm fine so stop worrying."" we were talking and i was crying and i remember telling her how close i was to killing myself the day i asked for help and got yelled at, i told her how easy it would have been for me to go get a kitchen knife and split my arm open or walk out of our yard and into the road in front of a car without anyone noticing. now here comes the fun part. she stops the car and says, ""do you want to get out?"" i'm like, i'm sorry what? why? she says, ""do you want to get out and jump in front of a car now?"" needless to say i was really pissed at her and let her know that's not the type of thing you say to a suicidal person. she told me some bullshit about how she cares about me and wants to help me and said i could call the suicide hotline if i wanted and that was fine with her. 

so yeah, that's it. that's the whole story. there's my proof that my parents are two-faced gaslighting mfs, and i am never going to get the help i need until i can move out

each severed at the neck,

I slowed my pace and glanced them all,

all aged and out of breath,

""you're next,"" they'd all say,

and often times they were hard to disregard,

until one day I came across the wall's latest addition,

a young face barely blue,

it took a deep breath and I relaxed,

for it had said something new,

Perverted desires getting me down,"Hey there,

Apologies for the NSFW content, hopefully it is not too inappropriate for this sub. 27 year old UK guy here, not sure what I'm hoping for necessarily by sharing this but hoping to find some answers.

I've struggled on and off with depression for most of my life as most people do. Some days are better than others and I have had spells with minimal ""down days"" over the years. 6 years ago I made a vow that I would seek to improve my life and so I started working out 6 days a week, taking care of myself, dressing well and trying to ""fake it"" confidence wise. I am generally in a much better place as a result. 

I think the biggest area of my life that contributes to my depression now is sexuality. I first started masturbating when I was around 13/14 years old to ""standard"" pornography. As time went on, this porn started to get more and more extreme to the point where I couldn't masturbate without extreme bondage, multiple sexes and the weirdest stuff you can imagine. I have tried with some success not masturbating over the last few months which makes me feel much better and more energetic however when I get to around a week or so of not doing it, I have overwhelming urges which make me view the same stuff and even try to arrange for the same things irl. For what it's worth, I consider myself completely straight and generally pretty vanilla during actual sex/relations. As soon as those urges kick in, I end up masturbating, feeling ashamed and heading pretty much back to square one. 

It's really affecting my interactions with women and I think also causing me to have ED.

Confession of a medico! Rant. I regret being a doctor!,"Ever since I joined this career, I lost my peace of mind. I took this out of peer and parental pressure also I thought this was prestigious career and will earn me good amount. when the  college started the reality hit me, everyday I cried myself to sleep. I was pretty extrovert girl but everyone in college isolated me and I got converted in a introvert now I lack self confidence, I remember several days I sat alone they all were hanging out and I sat in a corner with nobody talking to me. It broke my heart into pieces. 

I joined medicine on 2018 and now it's almost 2 years. I barely have any good friends. I cant ever see what I lack to be a good friend I was well behaved and nice and pretty attractive. Still everyone isolated me. They was never interested in whatever I talk. Never gave me an eye contact. So I'm fucked up with life. 
By gods grace I passed first year I never expected to pass because whole year I was depressed and didn't put forward much effort. Before joining there I was very studious I worked hard to get into medicine but now I lost all passion,

Everytime When I walk past the road alone I always think why do I even exist? What's the purpose ? Why I'm even coming to the place where I even dont have a favorite person? For what's sake I'm doing this unhappy career?
I think I can't give up or turn around for another career because I've no other options, I can't disappoint my parents and family neither I'm talented in anything so I have no choice..  but to continue this lifeless journey!

I will finish the course by 25. For fucks sake. I will have no friends or good memories to remember!

I am angry and frustrated and thats how my depression decides to show itself. So if i am upset about something im a bad person bc of my aggressive behavior toward myself (not others intentionally). Maybe i can find a quick way to just end it all without feeling a thing,1580066030.0,0.67,1

For those of you in therapy....,"Has your therapist ever told you what kind of mental issues they think you have? Are they required to tell you if you ask them what they think you have?

I’ve been seeing a therapist for a little over two years now and she’s never diagnosed me with anything, At least not to my knowledge. The funny thing is, she has been trying to diagnose my husband based on what I’ve told her about him because he has his own issues. Of course, she told me she couldn’t give a real diagnosis without actually seeing him face to face, But she was trying to figure out what he could possibly have and how it’s affecting me.

But she’s never told me what she thinks I have. And surely she must think I have some kind of mental issue because there’s no way she could possibly think that I’m in a healthy place mentally. I would just like to know so I can put a name to it And research it and try to figure out what caused it",1580065713.0,0.67,3

Never thought I’d be in this spot,"It’s so fucking scary to know exactly how I would kill myself without actually having to go through any pain. And it crosses my mind everyday at multiple points. My full script of my benzo and a bottle of vodka. Even when I’m driving sometimes I wish a car would hit me or a train would hit me when I drive past some tracks. I’m struggling so bad and the pain is so much to bare but the only thing keeping me here are my parents and the slight hope that one day it’ll end. But everyday just fucking sucks. I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy or had a good day.

Relatively speaking, I have it much better than other people in this world. Loving parents, a college education, a roof over my head, etc. 

But none of that matters when my parents would be so disappointed in the fact their kid loves drugs (weed, benzos, psychs, alcohol). When the only family outside of my parents in the US was my schizophrenic cousin who committed suicide. A college education in which i cheated the last 4 semesters of college to get by because i couldn’t make bring myself to go to class half the time. A college education where i spent most of it pretending i was someone I wasn’t and ending up hurting the only person who I’ve ever experienced love with and i know I will never get them back.  And everytime i try and connect with someone all i can think about is her and how much pain I’ve caused and it eats away at me everyday. A college education which has landed me nothing but job denial letters. A college education in which trying to deal with depression, i started taking SSRIs to try and help. The first day of Trintellix I snapped and punched my roommate/coworker one time for talking shit about my dog and how he doesn’t give a fuck about what I’ve been through and that landed me in jail on 6 months probation where even if i wanted to live life, I can’t because of an 11 PM curfew and getting randomly drug tested 3 times a week. And now i live in an apartment by myself until my lease is up in July and i work 2 times a week at a job i fucking hate with people i fucking hate and it gets so lonely when all your friends have the freedom to do whatever they want and when you try and join all you wish you could do is leave because it just isn’t fun. I know it could/will be better one day but the pain and loneliness is so much to bare. And the worst part about it all is that i used to have it all and i could’ve prevented everything.

Everyday i wake up wishing the day was over, or that i didn’t have the responsibility to walk or feed my dog. Every day I loathe getting ready to go about what i have to do. And on my free days the only thing i look forward to in a day is working out, but even some days i don’t have it in me and then i just feel like an even bigger piece of shit. but if i don’t workout I’ll just put on all the weight I’ve lost. Distracting myself via video games and Netflix can only go so far and do so much but it gets so lonely and I can’t even smoke or drink to distract it. 

I just needed to vent to people who know what depression feels like. You can sympathize or tell me it could be worse if you want or just scroll by, i don’t really care. I’m just so tired of this life.",1580064820.0,0.67,0
Infrequently feeling good again,"I don't really a good word to explain it, but I tend to go through bouts of just hating myself, not enough to put old yeller out. (not any more that is)

Some interesting title,"I first need to say that I find it rather difficult to vent. And its because I always feel ''fake'' or ''dramatic'' whenever I try to explain my thoughts and feelings more properly without rambling like a pig. I am not really intelligent to begin with, so thats that. Edit: I am so sorry for the stupid title I just really don't know what to put there.

I just need to say that I am absolutely frustrated with myself and the ability to make everything worse than it has to be. Ever since I was little I always felt sorry for no reason and I had self esteem issues, I know I have said thison a previous post but I just need to say it again. I just feel like a massive failure mostly because of my appearance, my social skills and my inability to stand up for myself. And if I do, I always make it cringy af. People usually tell me to shut up because of how annoying I am.

Well I absolutely hate making mistakes because I feel like a complete idiot afterwards. I am just fucking tired of me fucking up every single chance I get in life because either I am afraid I am not good enough or that I have to behave a specific way in order to get validated. Or I always feel like people secretly don't like me and that they are kinda like ''Okay, \_\_\_\_ whatever you say'' (I mean my whole personality revolved around making shitty puns or being that kind of person with cult jokes. gAmInG and dRawInG) and that was mainly with my former friends. They found me rather annoying which I don't exactly blame them because I was a moron plenty of times because I always tried to get validated or get attention or never telling my issues with them. Atleast, I believe they are and that proves my point considering after I left the group by my own choice they didn't even bother to say something (which I wasn't expecting them to, but it still kind of hurts. Except one and that was nice but yet, honestly, the more I look back the more cringy it was. I knew I wasn't even actually liked anyway, everyone was getting tired of me and they rather wanted me gone.) While it really upsets me I am glad I left anyway, Atleast no more overthinking while talking to them. And they aren't even bad people, I was pretty much the toxic one and even when I am pissed off and want my so wanted ''revenge'' I had it coming. I am pretty much a pathetic second class leech.

I had plenty of times at school where people make comments on my appearance or how weird I am and it really made me feel very uncomfortable in my own skin. It didn't feel right and the very fact I was too much of a coward to stand up for myself made it even worse. I wanted revenge, but that never actually came. Actually, whenever I actually stood up for myself I was ''out of line'' or ''a bitch'' and then I begin to doubt myself or feeling like I were too rude.  I usually got told to shut up if I did because I was like I said before annoying. I got yelled at by them during for example while we were playing a team sport. I was never doing something right, I got screamed at like some fucking animal, and perhaps I am one. Afterall I cannot behave like a normal person and I always try to be this ''sweet, loving, kind'' person but people see through my disguise anyway and they know I am full of shit lol. Even if I feel like I deserve respect its not like I am even capable of being nice to people, because I always assume they are out to ''get me'' or ''they aren't actually nice they just want to know my personal info''. Its getting really ridiculous at this point.

I treated people who actually wanted to help me like garbage because I either felt like I didn't deserve it or I felt like I had to do it myself. (Or I was just fucking pissed that they actually were in a way better position than me and then I have to treat them like garbage because HOW DARE YOU. I assume thats narcissism for ya) And well, yes, I were a bitch several times and I put myself to blame for everything. But as I got told a zillion times ''Its in the past, let it go'' Yeah but even if I let it go there will still be people who will treat me like shit or I find some kind of way to make everything awkward af like even if I try my best I either screw it up in some way or my mind does it for me. So it doesn't really help.

I am really prone to having a herd mentality which further supports my theory that I don't have a personality and all I do is being someone's yes-man. But really, all I really can do is using other people's opinions and then get mad like a prick if someone comes up with ACTUAL arguments. Because unlike me, they actually have a brain and they aren't a dumb sheep like me.

Even when they don't know me I still get treated like shit by people and while I really wish I could strangle them I feel like I deserve it, because really, all I have done is fucking things up. Its no surprise people see me as a subhuman, because I probably am one. I knew I was different from the start, and not the ''oh I am so special and gifted'' type of different. My mom always says that I am soft hearted and kind, but I know the truth. I cannot stand it when I see others fitting in while I don't, because people are usually dicks to me or I make everything awkward. Its one of the two. I always feel like I am not good enough and that mainly has to do with gatekeeping. ESPECIALLY WITH interests.

I have cried plenty of times before sleeping hoping for the day that someone or something will just erase me from existence, because all I really feel is that I just purely exist to make others feel like garbage, or myself, or just ruin everything all together. I don't really know what I am doing here and all I feel is bitterness, hatred, resentment and filth. I really feel filthy, and I really don't think I am capable of actually have the most normal things people can think of. Like, actual friendships or having an actual hobby. Even when I cry so many times and try my best to change it never actually works, because there is always something that brings me down. I am more prone to feeling hate and sadness, because it feels wayyyy more comfortable that way. And I am a disgusting, vile, bitter, person. My true colors are showing and everyone around me knows that, because I have become uglier physically.

&#x200B;

If you have been reading all of this, you shouldn't have but thanks anyway. I just need to get it out, I feel empty yet all I feel is sadness, hopelessness and anger. They were right about me for I am just a thing and all I can do is just make everything like shit. Everything I do is toxic or people just feel pure disgust when I am around. No one wants me and guess what?? **I DON'T EITHER**

But I am still here but I don't really care, eventually I am going to die just like everyone else and then it will be over. I have said it before and I will do it again, all I have become is a rotting, shell of my former self. Just everything about me that was considered to be ''favorable'' (and there weren't that many anyway) is gone. I don't feel sorry for others yet I force myself to, I force myself to feel bad or sad for everything or else I am a ''apathatic bitch'' and no one says that, but my mind does. Its never good enough and really I just want to know how it is to not give a damn and just move on.

But I can't, because I am weak and pathetic, and no one takes me seriously. I am just salty I cannot fit in and be like the others and then I am so jealous and bitter about the fact that I see everyone being so hyper and happy all the time even though I am sure that even if I would talk to them they do be like ''ew, why are you here?'' because thats exactly how it feels all the time. ''Just, who are you?''. But I am an oversensitive prick because everyone is the enemy, lol. I am overly sensitive, and I ruin everything.

I mean its not like I actually deserve it anyway, everytime I am with a group of people I worry about leaving my other friends which sounds ''nice'' and all but then I get this ego boost feeling better. But thats the whole thing, for the majority of my life my ways of thinking and self esteem was based on others. They were like the herders and I am the sheep.

I am too far gone to be ''fixed''. I blew away every chance I have gotten and my only way to express my anger is by physical '''''''force''''''''. I just can't fucking express myself no matter what. I always stutter like an idiot. Why am I made like this? Why is my voice like this? Why do I look like this? Why am I such a fucking joke?

Now I watch everyone having fun and be normal while I am just rotting in the corner, plotting ''revenge'' but honestly, for what reason anyway? It only makes me feel worse, yes, only me, because I don't give a fuck about how others feel even when I love to make it look that way. HOW DARE YOU TO BE HAPPIER THAN ME, HOW DARE YOU TO BE A DECENT HUMAN BEING, H O W  D A R E  Y O U  . Haha I'm just so sad and people know it.

No one ever spells or says my name right and that really shows my true importance, I am just an insect, a leech and a parasite. A manipulative, narcissistic witch. She plots about revenge to people who know about her shitty portrayal about her being a helpful angel but in reality she is a sad SAD WHORE.

Everyone is allowed to be happy when I am happy, if I am not happy no one can.

I secretly love misery and I shouldn't be here in the first place, I shouldn't have been born. I fantasize about getting revenge and hurting people even when they didn't do anything wrong but people know I am a disgusting filthy witch and they see that through my appearance, nothing is left of me, and  I am just rotting from inside more and more into becoming someone I hate.

And now I just kind of exist hoping for something to fucking kill me",1580063514.0,0.81,2
The only thing I want in life is to curl up in bed and stay there,"I've been lurking here for awhile but I'm tired of offloading my feelings onto the people close to me so here I am. All I want to do is curl up into my bed and never have to participate in society.

I haven’t cried in months even though I constantly feel like crying. It just won’t happen. And all this is causing issues in my long term relationship. She told me how she feels like I don’t talk about my feelings to her anymore.

tbh, i feel so tired. i keep buying and wanting things hoping they would fill the void. and they do for about a few minutes then it’s back to the same boring life

My hamster is no longer with us.,"I got 2 Russian dwarf hamsters just over a month ago. I've always wanted hamsters because they are adorable, so never mind dwarf hamsters. I saw a post on reddit of someone trying to find a home for their hamster and I just mentioned to my mum how I've been wanting a hamster. 

Next day she tells me i can get a hamster aslong as i take care of it and pay for all that it needs. I was over the moon, and in the next 3 hours I was in the pet shop getting supplies and my hamsters. I called one Whiskers because she wiggled her nose alot and it made her whiskers fly all over the place. The other I called bubbles because she had a bubbly personality and loved to be held. 

Well the other thing was that we had a cat. I knew it waent a good idea but I was prepared to take precautions in place to avoid him getting to them. 

Well I didnt end up well. While bubbles was in her tube the cat knocked down the tube, took her in his mouth and ran out. It happened in 3 seconds, I knew what was happening before I could react. I heard her cry out while he was running away.

Beyond depression?,"So it became apparent during my early mid teens that I had major depression and I struggled with it untill about 24ish which would be a year ago I've self medicated with alcohol and such (even going as far as kind of attempting to induce seratonin syndrome for the sake of self destruction) for almost all af that time, but in the past few years feeling more dependant on alcohol than ever, I realize I'm as miserable as always but I don't so much feel depressed anymore, just bitter, angry and lethargic.

I'm just wondering what this means, have I gotten what I thought I wanted and broken myself more? Have I reached a more adult or just new stage of depression with no more highs, lows and middles?

Zero Energy,"So much to do yet all I want is to sleep indefinitely.

I can't stand my parents even though I know they are the best and are very supportive,"So I have been skipping class while studying in a city 2h from my hometown. I live with a friend and I stay all weekends at my parents.

I feel down a lot, been with depression for 7 years now. I cope with it by playing videogames.

My dad is sure that videogames are what are causing me to be down and even though he always wants to help me he does everything he can do that I am not able to play any games.

I know that me playing is just a way of evading myself from my feelings but without games I feel so bad sometimes I have some suicidal thoughts and spend hours in bed before getting up.

My father has taken away from me my Xbox my laptop and gives me very little money to spend the week so I can't buy anything to play with. This doesn't work as I still play games on my phone.

When I come home I avoid talking to my parents because I feel bad because I played videogames and didn't go to class. I'm okay talking with my mother but my dad is just so negative and I feel like he is always attacking me even though he is trying to help.

I don't know what to do with my father, it feels like whatever he tells me not to do I do it. He told me I have to sleep early a couple weeks ago and these last two weeks I have gone to sleep the latest ever.

He tells me to go to the gym and I don't want to go even though when there was no one pushing me to it I went on my own and enjoyed it a lot.

Btw I'm 23 years old male and have been attending a psychologist (5 different ones) for 5 years. My family is not rich but it's close. My older brother has a very good paying job and my dad loves him for it, I feel like I won't ever come close to being like them like I am just trash and a pain in their asses. 

All I want to do is stay away from my family and live on my own so no one has to suffer for me.

I just needed to say this even though there's a lot more to it than this. Thank you for reading.",1580061661.0,0.67,1

"Been diagnosed with depression last week, though i only would appreciate if somebody would give a title to this riddle-like poem i made while waiting for a reply. Sorry you had to waste your time but thank you for noticing. :)","What is in a space, that doesn’t take place,
Is it ‘Nothingness’, that doesn’t take space,
Yet it’s so heavy, you can’t outweigh it,
If you’re lucky, you can get over it,

What is full, yet at the same time empty?
Empty yet so heavy, that you can’t carry,
What exist, yet at the same time unknown,
Exists yet no one has noticed it was there to be condoned,

A battlefield for a war, an area, a space,
Yet it has no soldiers, but fights in a fast pace,
A force to be reckoned with, in numbers like Persians,
Invades your space, and has its stance,

It doesn’t exist, yet it takes time,
It doesn’t act quick till you hear its chime,
“Nothing that affects a space, is it truly there?”
I can’t see it, but yes, it is here,

The space beside us, doesn’t occupy it,
It is nothing, yet you would get hit,
How big, how heavy, yet it doesn’t exist,
Contradictory in terms, but it does persist,

What is something that is nothing?
“Space? Air? Or the wind humming?”
It’s not really there, it’s not physical,
That is what you think and feel, it’s mental,

A place where everything meets, the mind,
No matter the capacity, everything will be left behind,
What you see but do not see at any time,
May put burdens, like the sounds to a mime,

“It does take place? yet doesn’t seem to make sense!”,
Nothing has and nothing will, all is tense,
“Human nature with all its might, will bring it’s light!”,
Yet followed by a dark, black hole sucked in and kept tight,

Decision of doing or not doing,
“Sounds like not being wise in something”,
There’s a bigger plane, wisdom cannot compare,
You saw, but you didn’t see too, it is there,

Like a problem of a leader with its citizens,
“Be tranquil? So the mind’s full of gardens?”,
No mind can think of gardens alone, nor calmness,
“That’s why it exist, it’s nothingness!”

This battelfield i said, you know what’s in it?
“No, i don’t, no braziers are being lit”,
A person alone, started fighting this war against them,
But still hasn’t finished, knitting what he needs to hem,

“It won’t matter if, the man is happy?”
He’s tired, peaceful is what he wants to be,
“So why did he fight in a war then?”
He can’t escape it, it’s a void for all men,

He’s battling the worst of enemies,
It doesn’t take space, it’s what he sees,
Yet not a sight of it, it takes a toll on him heavily,
“Then what is there that is isn’t there, decisions you see?” 

You’re right yet you’re wrong,
“How is that possible? Thinking for this long?”
“Get to the point! what’s there that isn’t there?”
Thoughts, my son, it can kill you, take care.

How do you know if your antidepressant is working? How do you know if you’re even depressed?,"I’ve been on cipralex for about 2 years, after a very bad bout of anxiety. It helped for a bit (I think). A few months ago, I had another breakdown and had Wellbutrin added to my medicines. I’ve heard such good things about it. But tbh, I don’t feel much better in terms of depression. I also don’t even know what depression feels like. I do feel very emotionally blunted (I felt this before taking any psych meds), I always feel super tired, but emotionally and I’m physically. I don’t really feel much sadness, and I don’t cry. I’ve been on wellbutrin since the beginning of December, and though the anxiety has mostly lifted, I still feel how I felt prior to my breakdown.

"Considering breaking up with gf, but worried she might self-harm/suicide","I know this seems like relationship advice material, but the main focus here is maintaining her mental health and preventing self-harm/suicide. A trip to the ER for something like that could financially sink her.

So I've been dating a girl for about 8 months. This is my first relationship and we're both mid 20s. Lately I've found myself irritated by little things she does, hanging out seems like a chore and I try to put it off. She and I both have problems with depression, but mine are relatively under control and fine. Hers are not. 

She has been trying to find the right meds, also is bipolar with some PTSD. She's been in abusive relationships, abused as a child. Life events are not good for her right now either. Some of those past relationships/decisions led to money troubles that seem to only get worse with time. She talks about marriage often and tries to subtly hint, but I don't want it with her. I know it's kind of selfish, but her financial problems, her permanent chronic health problems, and her psychological problems are not things that will be quickly fixed. I feel as though I am ((always)) having to financially and emotionally support her through so much and I just can't be her parent anymore. I need a partner I can depend on too. Telling her those things, esp the health/psych/finances influencing my decision could also just destroy her.

All of this to say, I love this girl dearly, there are things about her as a person that are just beautiful. She can be so smart, sweet, creative, and funny. But I only get one partner in life, and I can't imagine being bound to her. I've been mulling this over for the better part of two weeks, but I am very worried she could self-harm like she has done in the past or even attempt suicide. She also does not have good enough insurance or finances to support an ER visit and probably not even enough to see her psychiatrist. I am at a loss for what to do. I love her and don't want anything bad to happen to her. I don't think she would blackmail me threatening it, but I am concerned that she might actually self-harm/suicide because she sees me as the one.

How long do I stay in this to get her to a better place before I leave? She may get new well-paying job with insurance/money soon. Don't want to lead her on any longer, but right now I might be the only thing she thinks she has going for her. Any advice?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Considering breaking up with GF who has many health/psych/financial problems and has history of self-harm. Worried since she thinks I'm her soul-mate that she would self-harm/attempt suicide and if she does, she doesn't have health insurance/money for proper mental health treatment.",1580060734.0,0.67,0
I'm relapsing and I hate it,"A couple of years ago I went to counseling and was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. At the end of the treatment everything was better and I had coping mechanisms. However, now that I started graduate school everything seems to be triggering me, and I hate it. I cried and had a panic attack over a small fixable problem. I am upset because I don't get attention or compliments. I feel alone and left out. I feel like I wanna cry, and those thoughts of suicidal idealization are coming back again. I think what if I were to disappear would anyone care? I just wanna cry and yell.

Not sure if I'm getting better or worse...,"Instead of waking up feeling sad/hopeless, I've been waking up feeling numb. I've taken a few naps this week just to escape the numbness and boredom; for 6 weeks I haven't been able to really sleep so this is an improvement?

I had also been dissociating because I've been getting myself so worked up. My consciousness would detach from my body and I would be floating in a numb fog, a limbo state, for a while. It would be hard to talk, think, move, the whole 9 yards. I haven't dissociated like that in a couple of weeks, but I've been zoning out more often. I'm just laying on my couch because I'm bored, in pain, and can't bring myself to really do anything. It's, say, 2pm....and then it's 5pm. I don't fall asleep, just zone out. It feels like maybe 45 minutes go by, not 3 hours. But I'm not stressing myself out so much that I'm dissociating. So that seems like a good thing.


Instead of thinking a bunch of stupid things and making myself feel worthless and ashamed, I've just been feeling blank and numb. No more melancholy, that's a good thing right? But to have it replaced with this... I dunno. It's hard to tell if I'm improving or worsening.


Finally, when this episode began about 2 months ago I lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks because I wasn't eating. I've maintained my weight and am eating more now, I've likely gained 2 or 3 pounds. Still not cooking, because it's too much... But I'm eating more. Is that good?

Could i have saved her?,"""Aww, cya then..""

These are last words i heard from my friend SR, july 2, 2017, hours before she took her own life. Me and her have both been struggling with anorexia for years (i've been dealing with it since march 2010, she has since august 2012). I met her in mid 2013 along with 7 other anorexic at an ED gathering and the 9 of us have been eachother's outlets for self harm relief for all those years. I am the only one left standing of the group today. She was the last of the group to die.

On her day of death, she wanted to go out with me. We went out and had a blast, and she wanted me to stay over at her place for a little slumber party. Her house's pretty far from mine and i had an exam first thing in the morning so i refused.

""Aww, cya then.."" as i left.

Later that evening she rolled the dice and landed on the wrong side. Her dying wish was that everyone left alive from the group would celebrate her life instead of mourning her death.

Could i have saved her? Could i have stayed over and kept her going? Would it have kept her going for much longer? Is it my fault? She was my only reason to live. So why am i alive? Why, out of 9, do i have to tell the story? Why did i click that goddamn proana link back in 2010 that shot me into the worst fight of my life at age 7? I turned 15 years old 16 days after her death. Why did i keep rolling the dice, attempt after attempt, only to be the only one left standing today? 

I miss you. How's heaven? Hope they got a lot of horses there. I know you want me to keep fighting, but i just want to be with the 8 of you again. Why was i the one to recover? 

I could have saved her. I could have. But i didnt

I need the pain to stop,"A few days ago, I found out that a close friend of ours had passed away unexpectedly. Since then, I've been reflecting on my own mortality and that of my wife. I keep thinking about how at any minute one of us could just up and die. At first it frustrated and infuriated me. Now it's making me feel depressed to the point where I'm losing enthusiasm for everything I love.

It has opened my eyes to a pain that until now I've been able to deal with and manage with therapy and my anti-depressants. But now I feel like I'm losing my grip. It's like the fight is turning against me and I can not do anything to stop it. I'm not at a point where I am considering self-harm, but I am afraid that if this continues I'll fall down that path.

To help get rid of it, I reached out on social media to my old high school class to see how they were doing. All it has done is serve to remind me of how many plans I've left unfinished. How many things I've tossed to the wayside either by need or by loss of passion. I see how happy and full of life so many of them seem to be and I hate myself for not having the same joy. I hate them for being joyful when I'm suffering so much. I want to be happy for them, but instead I'm sitting here moping like a petulant child.

I want to stop hurting. I want to feel like I've done something with my life. I want to feel like I have value. I want to feel like I am loved. Today, I feel none of those things. Today, I feel like a pile of human waste. Today, I feel like I am worthless.",1580058668.0,1.0,0
Medical school is making me seriously depressed,"**This is my first time posting here so bear with me. I am a second year medical student and I’ve never felt this low and depressed before. To give you a little background, I was very happy in undergrad as I was able to meet a lot of my close friends. My college was in a metropolitan area too so there were lots of things to do and I was able to meet a lot of cool people. I majored in chemistry in college and always wanted to work in the makeup industry but my parents insisted that becoming a doctor is more stable and practical. When I applied to medical school, a part of me hoped I wouldn’t get in so I can have the chance to do something else, but I ended up getting into a medical school in a very rural area. After just two weeks of moving to my medical school, I started to feel extremely isolated. There is literally nothing to do in this rural town and all the people at my school are so different from me that I can’t bond with them. I have a couple of friends in medical school but I am never able to be myself around them and I’d rather be alone. I tried online dating to search for someone I can connect with but all the guys I consider datable are in the city which is 2 hours away. Driving that much interferes with my studying.**

**Every time I think about how my life got here, I don’t know what I did to deserve this. My relationship with my parents has also broken down because whenever I talk to them I can’t help but think about how they contributed to how my life is right now. I tried telling them multiple times that I’m sick and tired of medical school, that I’m tired of living in a rural area and I am very depressed, but they won’t LISTEN. All they tell me is that I have to persevere when I’m young and stop complaining. I know myself, and I know my depression is real. Ever since medical school, I had to cry myself to sleep all the time, and sometimes I have to go home after a few classes just to cry. All my college friends have been so supportive to me as they fly and visit me, but that’s all temporary. I still have to go to school everyday alone and be fake to everyone in my school. I also recently adopted a pet to help me mentally but it hasn’t been working. I just feel so lost, confused, and angry about my life right now. Is there anyone out there that has experienced the same thing? Any advice on how I can get through this?**",1580058581.0,1.0,2

Just to vent,"I posted this as a comment somewhere, in response to a question asking 'what I need to get off my chest', and I thought perhaps I'd share here on the off chance anyone had some useful suggestions. I'm at my wits end, and just dont know wtf to do anymore.

Despite my ability to act like I've got my life together, internally I'm falling apart completely. 

I've been considering looking for a new job, because my current one does not provide me with any room for further advancement, yet my current salary isnt quite enough to really be able to do anything other than scrape by. I love the work though, and actually enjoy being there. So to move on would be simply to persue money over happiness. For the last 10 months I've been going round and round with myself trying to decide what to do, and I make 0 progress.

My housing situation is what sucks up all my money, and I'm not certain that living with my current roommate any longer is good for my mental health. The market where I live though is through the roof, and it would cost me juat as much to rent a little studio apartment as it does to split the rent and bills at my current home. Against, I'm stuck being unable to come to any real conclusion of what I should do.

Finally, I've completely fallen in love with my best friend. She knows, but she' doesnt have the same sort of feelings for me as I do for her. I don't want to damage our friendship and risk pushing her away from me, and that I need to move on from those feelings I have for her. But when we hang out, that rational thinking goes out the window and i find myself falling harder and harder.

I've finally plucked up the courage to see a doctor about this. I'm in the UK and was wondering what I should expect from my visit. I'm incredibly nervous. I've not told anyone I know about my problems.

If I'm prescribed anything, is it likely to work straight away?

How long until I can expect to feel normal?",1580057374.0,1.0,1
It’s time,"I have been taking sertraline for 5 years. I started taking it during my divorce. I was doing well until the last 3 years. They were really bad. My depression was really bad. I could not go to work, lost my job, my oldest son ( 12 at the time) went to school and told them he wanted to kill himself. CPS got involved and basically went on a witch hunt which broke me. I attempted suicide and was hospitalized. Since then I have fought my way back little by little. My son is doing great! I have a fantastic job I love and am making the most money I ever made so finances are getting straightened out too. I feel stable and good. I stopped the sertraline a week ago. My prescription ran out and I could not get to my therapist to get a new one. I feel ready. The only thing I have noticed is I have been having very vivid dreams. During my depression I don’t remember dreaming at all. Has anyone stopped their sertraline and what was your experience? Thank you!!",1580057332.0,1.0,2

My whole life is fucked and I don't know how or why to live anymore.,"So a little backstory. I used to be religious and all the friends I had were Christian and well I went through a hard phase and so I decided I wanted to turn away from chrstianity. They all immedietally started shitting on me trying to get me to come back and when I didn't they called me a terrible horrible person. They spread lies about me to all my other friends to just about everyone that I did drugs. That I smoke and have sex and drink. And beat people. My reputation was destroyed with basically everybody. And all the parents and adults. My girlfriend who at the time was just a friend was the only one who believed me and didn't listen to anyone else. 
As well as my has started forcing me to go to her Catholic church. Again I'm not religious and when I was I was protistant. So all of a sudden my friends basically all of them have turned against me. I have no one to talk to I don't have a phone that I'm allowed I have a computer but I can't be on it ever. My girlfriend and are were split and are not aloud to see eachother by our parents because of the rumors. So we sent notes to one another. Her mom found out, told my mom. My mom has taken everything away from me. Now I dont know if I will ever be able to see my girl again. I love her so very much and I can't live without her. I don't have any friends to talk to. And my mom is trying to control every bit of my life. Everyone thinks I'm this terrible horrible person now and I don't know what to do. It seems better to just kill myself but I always think maybe one day I can see my girl again. I always think that if I died it would hurt her more then anything ever could and so I don't know what to do. Everything is terrible rn and there's no way it could get better. Or at least from what I see.

I need help idk what to do. Does anyone have any advice or help or counsel they can give me.

I'll end up homeless sometime in the next year and I really don't care.,"I've been self sabotaging myself for years. Not on purpose, but there's things I simply can't do due to my anxiety. For example, I haven't filed my taxes in several years because I can't even look at the paperwork. My credit score is low enough now that I can't get a loan to fix my car, so I won't be able to drive to work much longer. And this is probably the year the IRS will come after me for not filing. And I don't care about any of this. I'm ready to be homeless. It's where I belong. My only worry is my cat. The only person other than me she even tolerates is my mom. I'm hoping she'll warm up to my mom eventually because I'm going to have to give her to her. Sadie is my world, but I can't take care of her if I don't have a place to live. Sorry.

I’m in a hole...,"
I think that I desperately need someone to talk to or just post this to vent my shit out. I’ve felt like I’m in this limbo of life, and I seriously can’t find the self-control to escape. I’m aware that I’m depressed and some of the reasons why I’m depressed, but I can’t get myself out. I don’t understand how I have friends that I talk to about every day and a family that I know I can count on. Yet, I feel so lonely, like I’m just so cramped in my head like I don’t know what to do. Sometimes I feel like no one else has the same type of deep thought that I’m in, it's weird. I can be involved in a conversation, but I am thinking of 100 ways it can go one way or the other. When it comes to women, that’s what I think causes me to feel the most alone. This is probably the part that people say, “forget about that... you got time... you got your whole life ahead of you.” When I talk to my friends, my family, the type of people I’m supposed to talk to about it... I can’t. I’m either the laughing stock for what I fucked up on or asked when the time is going to come. Every time I go out to see a movie and my friends gf comes I always hear my mom, “nobody for you.” Or the time I was suppose to go out with this girl ( or should I say lead on to just get ghosted) and told my mom it wasn’t happening. She said, “I know this isn’t easy for you.” That, for some reason, broke me. Anyways, I’m not happy with myself, and I’m noticing it more and more like it’s a disease spreading. I moments where I'm happy and having a good time still, but when I'm alone, I'm alone. I don’t know man, I have dreams and aspirations, but I just can’t get out of this whole.",1580056490.0,1.0,1

Off My Chest,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health, in a heavy way, for that past few weeks. Roughly for the past 7 years I’ve been in therapy multiple times a week. This has helped me, in tremendous ways put the pieces of my past together, and helped me grow into a functioning adult, to better understand myself, and help me navigate my life in the world around me. I can say that I’ve benefitted, and am blessed to afford this treatment.

Although despite this growth, and the privilege to afford this help, there is an underlining current, that bobs its insidious head to the surface, that at times I just can’t seem to shake.

I was emotionally/physically abused by my Father for the first part of my life. My first memories with him are fear so paralyzing it was as if my breath left my body, to afraid to move as he inched closer to me face, literally growling, for any perceived slight I had done. My gig line wasn’t straight; I was a “filthy pig”, I called out for my Mom; I “didn’t love him”, and “how dare I treat” him that way. I was humiliated and tortured by him, everyday, without respite. I use to have nightmares as a child, and would wake up with paralyzing anxiety. I remember lying in my bed at night, hearing the heavy footsteps of what I thought was a monster down the hall coming to my room, “boom! boom! boom!”. I realized after time that the footsteps were the sound of my beating, panic stricken heart, and realized much later that the monster was my subconscious’s way of managing the horror I experienced everyday.

I was made to learn by him that I was worthless. That I didn’t deserve the effort put into love. He always told me I was a spoiled brat. Even now, when I see a “normal” or what seems to be a “good enough” stable family I can’t help to look and feel how strange and different that is from what I experienced.

It’s interesting because the more healthy I become, and the more I recover, the more clear I’m able to see how not normal my experience was. When his abuse was all I knew, it was normalized in a sense. I had the understanding that he was abusive, but those words had no substance. It was only after I started to have loving relationships, growth in therapy, and a more adult relationship with my Mom, who had divorced him when I was just a teenager, that I could look back and understand the horror to its fuller extent.

And I was angry at my Mom. And still at times angry, grief stricken by her. How could she have picked a man like this? A man like this to create a family with? What was she thinking? How could she not see the gravity of her choice??

Despite her past choices, she has grown as well through therapy. She is able to have a relationship with me, is able to talk with me about my pain, about her pain and the psychology of her decisions that led her to marry someone like my father. She can tell me that she loves me. She always could, and I can feel it. I thank God for her in my life.

So despite my growth, my maturation, becoming an adult, I have to say that I feel tainted by my Father. He is not in my life, I cut the relationship, and feel better because of it. But besides my forward momentum, I can’t turn away from the reality that he is just that, my Father. That is what I had, and that is what will always be. It is as if a mark has been placed on me, that cannot be undone. I come from him, and I don’t want to. I want him to disappear. I feel, sometimes more, sometimes less, that he is a nightmare that I cannot wake up from.",1580056425.0,1.0,0

My life is a depressing shit show. See for yourself!,"My problems are too great and too permanent for my life to ever improve at this point. I think about dying every day, and it makes me happy knowing I'm slowly building the courage to pull the (figurative) trigger. 

I have HIV. I am undetectable which basically means I cannot transmit it and will live a normal life, but the social stigma is too much. I have gotten rejected over and over again the moment I tell a potential partner. I've gotten advice on when and how to tell people, but nothing changes the outcome. It hurts a little more every time, and I become a little more hopeless. The only alternative is to hide it, and in a way that feels even worse, having to lie about who I am in order to be accepted. 

A few years ago I reached out to a female friend. The love of my life. We've been friends for over a decade but never dated, but finally did this time. An affair. It was passionate and fun and incredible. She didn't judge me for my disease, and wasn't afraid of having sex with me. This eventually changed, though, and her love for me turned to resentment and disgust. It's over forever with her, and she hurt me more than anyone else ever has. This is the person I've always wanted to be with, my best friend, the one person who has never hurt me - and in the end she turned out to be more cruel than I could ever imagine. It's been 2 years since we broke it off and I still miss her so much. I wish I was exaggerating, but I cry every day over her; I doubt I'll ever get over her. She broke me. 

 When she ended it I started snorting heroin. I wanted to die, or at least numb the pain. I became addicted. I ran through my savings - $10,000. That was my money for a car. Now I'm on methadone, but I still get dope and meth fairly often. When I was diagnosed with HIV is when my foray into drugs first began and I have spent easily over $50,000 between crack, heroin, and meth. 

I have no real friends. I have no one to talk to about my troubles. I have only a couple people who would be sad if I were gone. I feel so incredibly lonely, and unloved, and broken.

I have no relationship with my family. My mom and sister hate me. They have caused me so much trauma.

I'm short, fat, bald, awkward, poor, depressed, anxious. I'm damaged goods and drug addled. Anyone who truly knows me, does not want me. I don't want myself. 

I'm 30 and I have nothing to my name. All I have going for me is a good job which I am excellent at. 

I have a lifelong STD which makes it virtually impossible to have any kind of real relationship; I have an opiate addiction when I never did before, directly related to how I coped with the loss of a girl. I have no one in real life to talk to about these things. I am so behind in life, it's pathetic. What kind of future could I possibly have? Not a good one, I know that much. 

My life is over by many different measures. There is only pain and loss and suffering in my future. As far as I'm concerned my desire to kill myself is as much justified as a person who is chronically ill. I want to end it so bad; one day, hopefully soon, I will have the courage to do it.",1580055892.0,0.67,2

AMA! My depression story to this day.,"i wanna start by saying that i have had suicide thoughts for 10+, sent to a school doctor in 2009 after i was diagnosed with psoriasis and more following issues happend after that, my parents or more so my mom couldn't handle money very well, she took illegal loans in my fathers name we ended up in heavy debt for years, i had to wear the same clothes every day for school, i had no money to treat my psoriasis i was young (16) at the time and very shy, socially awkward around grown ups. I didn't really know how to open up back then. 

My family would argue more than 5 times per week my father was very angry about the debt, the loans, my lying mother and her shady things. He would beat her up when i had friends over it was a rough time. Sometimes when i was on skype my friends would hear them argue and throw punches and what not, i was too scared to stand up for any of them i remember my childhood being very abusive, beaten alot for literally nothing just cause they wanted to beat me. Today i have a boyfriend i am gay i am 26 years old typing this, my family if you wanna call them that  are muslims, they are not okay with me having a relationship with another man. They still dont know about it to this day. It's been 5 years since i met my SO. I still live at home cause they literally made me apply for social care when i graduated from school. Mom also hid my application letters from different schools so i thought i never had a future anywhere ( i found out way later ) 

i have 2 siblings older than me, in fact they both moved away from us. ( we talk rarely ) in 2016 my dad had a major stroke, he got paralyzed in half i feel very sorry for him to this day, he does nothing anymore he is always in his couch watching tv  24/7  it feels like i lost my dad that day, my mom changed but not for the better she is different takes meds but she takes care of him. But even to this day they still argue about money and small things. Small things becomes big things and they end up fightning like alot.

i have regular contact with my psychiatrist, doctor , lots of people that believe in me and wanna see me grow but i keep falling back down the rabbit hole everytime i pressure my self to try something new could be a placement for a work or a tryout for something. i keep thinking about my home situation and i cant let it go it drags me down.

It feels like i am bound and stuck here forever with them, i dont have a job i have social care money but it's not much, my siblings are always on me about how i cant leave them. I just got caught inbetween and i dont know what to do, i wanna start my own life i wanna move on i wanna  be able to have friends in my own place..But they are stopping me and making me feel like i am guilty to stay and take care of their issues. They are not my problem but no one wants to listen to what i have to say.  

I am still to this day suicidal from time to time, when i feel down i get really bad extreme emotions only thing keeping me alive is a small chance for hope. I was so happy  before all this i dont know what really changed my childhood affected me too much and i have to get my own place.. there is probably people out there like me, if you managed to read it all i wanna say thank you to everyone please leave a comment and help me <3 i read most threads here and i always try to be positive and help others, the reason i am still here and alive is cause i rather help other people than myself.

What is the least triggering way to bring up an ESA to my therapist?,"I have been diagnosed with situational depression and general anxiety.

He's mentioned talking to her about maybe working towards getting an ESA so that I may have at least one companion at home.

I feel like I'm so behind in life and everything is pointless?,"Hi. Hope you're doing well.
24F here.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety for 8 years now and although sometimes it seems to get better I always relapse.

Right when I was about to start university, 5 years ago, my parents got a messy divorce and I had to move with my mom to a new city where I had no friends. It really took a toll on me and I lost my confidence. I was never super confident but I was capable of things. I had good grades, I was sure I was gonna have a decent future. 

It all changed though, and today I'm so insecure and self conscious about everything that I started to avoid situations just so I don't embarrass myself. 

It's been 5 years and I still don't have my degree. Actually, it was supposed to take 3 years and I have only passed about 1 year and a half of it in total. It's so fucking ridiculous. 

I'm European so studying isn't expensive compared to places like USA, but having a degree is considered prestigious everywhere in the world.

I just don't believe in myself and the more it takes for me to finish my degree the more anxious I feel because I'm so behind all my friends. I'm ashamed to admit I'm still studying when I'm with them, because I feel like an absolute failure.
I have no motivation to study, and I think that at this point, even if I did finish my degree in the next 2 years, I wouldn't even be proud of it because I would have taken like twice the time I was supposed to.

Please help me, I feel so bad. My dad says he's ashamed of me and has to lie to his friends bc their children have already finished their degrees.
I feel like I'll never finish mine, and I just lost another semester. I feel like it's useless to expect something different from the next semester because I'm always the same shit.",1580051996.0,1.0,2

Therapy,"I really want to get therapy, but I’m a broke student who can’t afford it. I always have moments of “Oh, I’m finally getting better. Everything is going to be ok, finally.” and then I spiral into depression again and I just.. want it to be over. I’ve been dealing with depression for so long and I’m so sick of it. I want to feel good. I want to feel normal. But therapy is so fucking expensive and the price for 3-5 sessions honestly scares me. 

I’m scared that I will eventually end my life, because I recently found out my student debt doesn’t go to my family if I were to die (in my country). This was one of the main things that was holding me back.
I want to talk to my family about it, but I don’t want to bother them and I feel so fucking lonely all the time even though it’s my own fault.

I honestly don’t know what to do and everything just feels so stupid. I started dating someone, but I don’t think he likes me as much as I like him and I don’t want to bother him with my mental issues because it can be a lot to deal with. I just don’t know what to do and I feel so stupid all the time. I feel stupid for being such a failure that I can’t even function normally while I have such an amazing family. I constantly feel like I’m letting them down and I feel so guilty for not being what they deserve.

This is where im currently at. But this phase is a bit diffrent. Idk how to describe it.

I am lost,"Hello 

This is the first time im doing anything like this. Im not sure what im searching for in writing this but maybe it will relieve some stress or something.

My mom is a diabetic, has  cirrhosis of the liver and is severely depressed. At this point in time I've been taking care of her on and off for the past 3 years. She didn't always need someone  to take care of her but about 3 years ago she had gotten very sick. She never had the best of balance and shed always fall a lot. One day she fell  coming in the front door and landed on her purse. She happen to have a bottle of Coke in her purse and landed directly on it. Now at the time we didn't think anything of it because she's taken many and many of minor falls so we just kind of let it go. After about 2-3 weeks go by she starts complaining of this pain in her side and back. Again we didn't think much of it until it progressively got worse. so we took her to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests and couldn't find anything. Naturally since they couldn't find anything they sent her home and told her to apply ice and heat, the usual stuff. The pain just kept getting worse and worse so we ended up taking her back to the hospital and telling them nothing has helped and everything is getting worse. Again they ran all kinds of tests and finally found that she had a hematoma on the backside of her left kidney. This was causing an infection and this infection on top of her liver cirrhosis was  causing her to be very confused, not knowing where she is, not recognizing my family members or I, and essentially she was hallucinating.  

Once they found the infection they did a procedure where they put a tube through he back to drain the blood that was built on the kidney. Now the infection was pretty bad when they found it and it did damage her liver more than it already was so her liver doctor pretty much demanded that she needs to be sent to a way more advanced hospital to get a liver transplant. So away we went to the to the next hospital, which I didn't mind because I knew they would take way better care of her than the hospital closest to us. 

So we arrive and this new hospital and of course they run all their own test their own tests there so they have them on file. Now this is the hospital where she goes to every 6 months for check ups on her liver so her main liver doctor was there. Over the next few days it felt like about 200 doctors came in one of which was her liver doctor. He said we will have to see how the treatment works on the kidneys to determine of she needs a liver transplant. About another week goes by and she is getting better but very slowly. She ended up not having to get a transplant but the liver was still damaged from the kidney infection. This damage that the infection caused to the liver was raising her ammonia levels very high. When your ammonia levels get this high is causes your memory to become very forgetful and confused. The doctors put her on a few different pills and medication to drop her ammonia levels but they said she will have good days and bad days, some days she wont be confused or forgetful at all, some days she will even on the medication. 

About 2 weeks go by and she is ready to be sent home. They wanted to send her to a nursing home for rehab or we could just have the nurses come to the house to do it. We thought the house option was the best so that's what we went with but she needed to be put on an IV 3 times a day for about a month and a half so the doctors really preferred she  go to a nursing home. My family talked and I decided to step up to the plate and said I would be able to take care of her because my brother and dad had to get back to work because they've been off for this whole month and a half span that this has been going on for. I was also unemployed at the time so I had no problem doing this. long with the IV infusions I was handling her medication, insulin, and all the doctors appointments. 

Fast forward 2 months to when all the nurses and rehab people discharged her. She was better but wasn't, if that makes sense. She still needed help getting up and moving around. I was still handling her medication and insulin as well because she was still forgetful and confused most days. 

Now during this time her depression got worse. Which was a given considering all she went through but I also felt it effecting me. It wasn't bad but there were somedays where id wake up and just not feel right. I just didn't want to get up I had no drive to do anything but I powered through it because I knew I had to help my mom. I didn't think much of it at the time because I had a lot on my plate but it progressivly gotten worse. 

Fast forward to about 6 months ago, , I'm still taking care of my mom. Still unemployed and have become very depressed. At this point everyday when I wake up I wish I hadn't. This caused me to become very angry all the time and most of the times I always took it out on my mom. Which I never should have done, it wasn't her fault. We would always argue because I couldn't get a job because I was taking care of her and was afraid to leave her alone for long periods of time. I also had no IRL friends which gave me no one to talk too. The only friends I have are the people I play video games with and I feel like if I talk to them about this they will feel differently of me. I was in a dark place and couldn't fid the light. I didn't see a point to waking up anymore. Every day I wake up give my mom her meds and make some breakfast for her and then I play video games pretty much all day helping her when she needs it.

About 4 months ago the worst possible thing happened. My mom was decorating for Halloween and she thought it would be a good idea to try and go get the Halloween decorations from the basement without telling anyone at 11:30 at night. I was in my room and I heard a few very loud thuds and then a lot of screaming. I ran to the top of the stairs and my mom was at the bottom bleeding from her head very badly. I ran and got my dad and called 911. She was rushed to the hospital downtown because that was the closest hospital with a trauma unit. It was a few hours before we could see her but they finally let us back and she was in bad shape. She had a pretty good size cut on the top of her head but fortunately her skull was intact. They told us she may need Brain surgery because she had a minor brain bleed under her skull. So they were going to run a cat scan of her brain every 2 hours to see if the bleed was getting better or worse. After a solid 8 hours of waiting for results the doctor told us the bleed was very minor and she did not need surgery, in which we were extremely grateful for. I don't want to ramble on about this hospital experience too so I'm just going to give you the short of it. The fall made everything worse as you can imagine. She started having seizures, not major ones but minor seizures about once a day. Like I said they aren't severe, she will just kind of pass out for a few minutes at a time and come out of it not knowing what happened. She was in the hospital about a week and they sent her home. We had the nurses and rehab people come to the house again instead of a nursing home. This time was a lot worse though. She needed a lot of help getting up and moving around. Which wasn't a problem for me but she felt like a bourdon. She always tells me that she ruined my life and I cant get a job because of her. I just kind of ignore her when she talks about this because I'm not always sure what I should say. There's been times where I've disagreed with her but it somehow always ends up in an arguement. 

Now we are at present day. My mom is still having these minor seizures.  I'm still taking care of her meds, insulin, and doctor appointments. I am still depressed but not at bad as 6 months ago. That incident was kind of a little wake up call but the depression is still very much present and both my mom and I. I still wake up with a dark cloud over my head everyday. Its gotten to a point where I am very antisocial, I absolutely hate leaving my house and I'm very secluded from everyone. Like I said earlier these  past 3 years I haven't really had any IRL friends, just my friends on Xbox and PC. I really want to get a job and live a life but I cant leave my mom like that. She can not be alone for more than an hour at a time. I've thought about streaming but I am in no condition, mental health wise, to do that. I may try and sign up for uber just so i have some sort of income and i can control my schedule but in the back of my head theres alwasy that little voice telling me i will never amount up to anything and im worthless. That voice has been in control of me for to long and im tired of it.

"At a ""healing"" festival and I'm more depressed than ever.","I stepped out of my comfort zone today and agreed to go to a local festival/convention thingy with someone I know relatively well, but wouldn't consider them a close friend.

I regretted my decision as soon as I said yes, realising that it's the day before payday so I barely had enough to cover the entrance fee, let alone buy anything (including food) while I'm out.

My companion went ahead and booked herself a 30 minute massage and left me to my own devices.

The energy here is nice enough, lots of people doing readings, therapies and selling crystals and things. It's a somewhat bizarre feeling to be surrounded by these vibes and yet I feel more empty and alone than ever. Like my body is here and my mind is trying to join in but it somehow feels forced, and fake.

Since I was driven here I have no idea how much longer I may be here. Is it time I just accepted I'm awful at socialising?",1580044231.0,0.67,4

How long is too long for someone suffering from depression?,"I was in shower the other day and a kept thinking about how long was I suffering with my old friend depression. How many years of my life I had lost before I started my treatment.
But, still, after 8 years with her and 6 years taking all those meds, I still feel like a piece of shit almost everyday. 

I feel very bad for feeling like this. I mean, I have the job that I've been pursuing for the last 2y, I have my own apartment, two dogs and a amazing father. Am I ungrateful by feeling like shit everyday? Even having all that I've ever wanted.

About 4 years ago I tried to kill myself. Sometime I think things like if all these feelings that I have are some kind of punishment for trying to kill my self or for wishing to be dead so many times.

Support doesn't exist and it is pointless pretending it does,"When I left sixth form in 2019 I almost immediately fell into a poor mental state. The two years I had there were mostly worthless and I learned little from them. When I revealed my personal issues I found nobody around me seemed to have much patience for them, I was simply made to send a referral to the local mental health service. After a few months of inactivity I had an appointment where they said I had anxiety. They booked me for an appointment with the GP without my knowledge, a man who decided that prescribing antidepressants was pointless because 'I was able to come and visit him' (???) meaning that the appointment was a mutual waste of mine and his time.

Now it is almost February of the new year and I have received nothing apart from a letter stating that I have not been forgotten and I am still important. I have no faith in the service these people are providing or therapy in general (I think it's a scam and that it's pathetic to charge people for help because their mood is poor) and my mental state is rapidly declining. I have completely lost my interests in everything, including my interest in art/animation which I thought was my calling in life (I can thank the absolutely awful graphic design course I took for two years for that, what a fucking waste of life).

I currently feel completely alone in my family's home. I have never been able to connect to people properly and meaningfully. I have always been misanthropic and now I am beginning to see other people as being completely worthless. None of this is worth it. Working and learning for a living is pointless when you fundamentally loathe everyone and everything around you. I cancelled my application to university and I have no idea where my future will take me now. Everything I do seems completely asinine and pointless.

The only reason I am typing this is because I derive some kind of warped pleasure in making people know how miserable I have always been. It is morbidly gratifying to know people are helpless to cure or change me, to look back on the asinine shallow years of my life and how useless they have been.

Nothing is satisfactory in life. Exercise does not work as I have consistently been exercising for a week and noticed no considerable change. Talking to people is useless and gets me nowhere. Everything feels mediocre and shallow.

The strange thing is I feel perfectly fine and healthy. I simply can't see any meaning to life.",1580042577.0,0.6,5

I recently got dumped by my girlfriend , we were nearing our first year anniversary, and the reason that she told me, is that she hated me all of a sudden,and  she said that, I was very sad and clingy unlike my persona.  That's what made my cover snap. I wasn't very happy anymore, and the people around me are starting to notice.  I couldn't find anything interesting anymore, I would just eat whatever's on the fridge and not care about anything. My best friend told me to go bars and just find another girl.

Happiness is weird- I don't trust it.," I struggle with depression. I'm always sad in someway ranging from the mild 'WTF am I doing with my life, the world is a bad place' to 'Oh God, I want to die, someone please kill me, I can't do it anymore.' Or somewhere in between.

Yesterday, I did my very first poetry reading and it went really well. It's something I would never have done in a million years because I have a stammer and social anxiety but I just decided to go for it.  People loved it, said it was amazing and I felt really good about myself.

And then I went home, had my dinner and went on my laptop and started listening to a bit of Charlie Puth. And, I didn't feel sad at all. For the first time in ages I felt at peace.  And it felt weird.  As if my depression was going to jump out from behind a wall and  punk me and be like 'Down you go, bitch.'   I don't trust happiness. I'm always waiting for the catch.

My life is tearing apart.,"I dont even know where to start. I know there are people in far worse situations then me but i realy want to get this off my chest.
My family moved to America when I was 5 and returned back to Korea when i was 12.
I always thought it was a blessing for me to be able to live the America life but when i came to Korea i realized that I couldn't fit in I didnt know much Korean and their culture so I tried my best to socialize.I even got bullied sometimes bcus of my bad Korean. Everyday i wanted to go back to America for i hated the culture here in Korea but I knew nothing would change even if I told my Parents so I always lied that I fit in  and was fine my younger brother on the other hand who came back to Korea  at a far younger age socialized fine for he was too young to start school and socialize at America (he only finished up to first grade while I finished up to 7th grade)
Although it was pretty tough I did make a lot of friends and had a great time.
Then my parents decided to move to a different city in the middle of the Highschool year
(Bad timing i know)
My hormones were very unstable at that time so I had a hard time making friends.
Even though I couldn't fit in well I was a pretty good looking Kid so some girls had a crush on me and even started talking to me I managed to survive by hanging out with girls (I know this sounds weird but none of the boys realy liked me for Im very bad at sports) 
But then all this came crashing down when I catched a cold and started breathing  with my mouth my face suddenly became elongated and flat i was no longer the attractive kid and more of a wow he turned ugly type of kid to make things worse suddenly my skin turned bad and basically made my already uglified face even more wack also i started wearing glasses at this point of time.
When I returned to school most of the girls who had a crush on me looked at me with a what the heck happened to you look and started to stop talking to me. I had no friends to cheer me up and now I was completely alone a typical loser
Im pretty much bad at everything sports&study etc its not like i dont try its just whenever i try something I always fail no matter how hard i try 
I only had my looks but now that my looks were taken from me I was basically a useless human who just breathes.I tried making freinds but for i have no idea what the other guys were talking about since i do not play their korean games or watch their korean tv shows i tried playing those games but I realy sucked at it and I couldn't even understand the Korean words which the people in the Tv show was saying.
So basically i had no sharing interest with anybody .
I had to sit alone during recess but the feeling of sitting alone was pretty humiliating that i always pretended to sleep and laid down on my desk sometimes my neck hurt so bad and i longed to get up and stretch but I couldn't for it would show that i am awake and being alone.
Some kids took notice of this and started teasing and picking on me.
After living like this At school i always came home feeling like  shit I always said I was okay and lied to my parents that everything is fine.I didnt feel like doing anything when i came home and stayed in bed and just gloomly looked at my phone as a distraction from reality. My family started worrying about me for i used to be a very outgoing kid

They started asking me questions on why I was acting this way I was too embarrassed to tell them why I was stressed out and i just told them ""im  just going through that teen phase""
In the inside i was actually pretty mad that my family couldnt understand that moving to a new country and then suddenly moving to a new city would mess up a kid a little.
I once told my mom about my situation but she started breaking down crying for she has weak mentality i didnt want to be the cause of pain for our family so i decided not to say anything to anyone els.

my younger brother who socialized well in this new environment (for he is only an elementary school kid and thats pretty much the time where you make friends) 
Started becoming more and more better person than I ever was  he got great test scores medals for sports competitions and he even got super good looking  
I started getting extremely jealous of my younger brother and wished that my life was like his
I hated myself for feeling nothing but Jealousy when i look at my younger brother instead of brotherly love
My parents started to give more attention to my perfect younger brother
And i was pretty much an outcast of the familiy
because of my extreme loneliness i started doing bad stuff like smoking and watching bad things on the internet 
Last night i suddenly started crying in bed at how hard things got bad
honestly right now I dont even know what to do I cant see how i can improve myself.



I dont want to exactly die but sometimes when i look out the window I get terrible thoughts.

My parents are thinking of moving to a new city
But at this poing i dont realy care.

"Not sure if relapsing, stress or PMS","I have a doctors appointment tomorrow to discuss reducing my meds but since I made the appointment, I feel like I’m getting bad again. I mostly struggle with anxiety but I’ve had episodes of depression over the years, including suicidal thoughts. 

I’ve been on a combo of ADs and beta-blockers for about 3 years, and have felt mostly stable in my moods for a while. The blue days have been less extreme and less frequent, and about a month ago I went to see the doctor to talk about weaning off.

She asked how I’d been and I explained that Christmas and work had been stressful, especially as my boyfriend and I had rescued a puppy at the end of November, so she said give it a month then come back. 

Since then everything feels harder. I feel more tired. So tired. I’m due on soon and I know I get more irritable and emotional at this time, but it’s so much worse this month. I’ve cried uncontrollably for the past couple of hours, I’m calming now, but yesterday I had a similar episode.

The puppy is learning, slowly but surely, but it’s hard work and emotionally draining at times. My BF is amazing and does most of the dog walking, but even so I find myself getting mad at him over stupid stuff.

Work is busy and stressful and the days feel long, but I enjoy my job and get on with my colleagues and managers. 

I feel guilty for not doing more exercise which would help my moods and my body insecurities and my health. I feel guilty for not doing more with the puppy. I feel guilty for not being a better girlfriend. I feel guilty for not being a better friend and sister. I have suicidal thoughts occasionally but never any intent... I just sort of wish something would happen to me and then it’s out of my hands, but then I feel guilty again; that’s an easy way out for me but not my BF or family or friends.

It’s “H”, she’s super drunk, and I stood at my window and talk, she keeps asking me to go home with her (we’ve been best friends since 4th grade, I knew she had a crush on me since then) and I used to have dreams about us dating, so I liked her too. But she’s gotten so bad to the point where she always drank, she started smoking and doing pills o help with her depression. so I said “you live 5 houses down the road, you can walk, I’ll even watch you” and she kept insisting that I walk her home (you can see her house from my place) and I just kept pushing her request away to walk her home, so she walks home, she’s drunk, but it’s only a few houses away, maybe 300 feet away, and it’s about 4:00am now, she gets home and I assume she passes out, I later found out the next day that she took her own life by hanging herself in her closet.

I wanted a life with this girl. It fucked me up mentally, I was already depressed, insecure and suicidal at 16. So this hurt me. I still have dreams of us together, this was 6 years ago. I wanted to be her soul mate and help her. I tried to hang myself later that year because of all the guilt that built up, if I just walked her home that night, would she not have done it? Would I be the one to find her? Or would my life be in a better place than it is now? I miss her all the time. It sucks losing your best friend when you think you could’ve prevented it.

But wait I’m not done... there’s 3 more... I’ll make this one short. 

Fast forward to me being 17, the next year. Best friend was always happy, always wanted to make everyone laugh, always super caring and wanted to help everyone with their problems, again, we’ve been friends since 4th grade, where me, H and B met actually, but later in life he started fighting, getting into trouble, doing drugs, selling drugs, dropped out, he really let himself go and I tried helping, talking, visiting, giving advice, he listened but he didn’t wanna process the information, I feel like he already planned it out and didn’t want to back out....around the Christmas Holidays I was a few hours away, visiting my other side of the family, and I got a message on Facebook telling me that “B” was found in his front yard hanging from a Tree... 

I had no feelings.... I was completely numb with disbelief, I didn’t cry. I couldn’t, I don’t know why. My body just didn’t want to work. I dropped school for 2 weeks and failed my classes so I went to school another year.


Now we’re 18, my grade 12 year. My ABSOLUTE best friend since diapers. My brother, my best pal, played sports, travelled everywhere, fought each other, fought for each other. His name is “W”, I always knew something was  “a little off” about him but I couldn’t tell, turns out he was gay, which I don’t care about, he’s my best friend. But his father was extremely homophobic and he was so scared of what his dad would think, that it ate at him when his dad found out. His father resented him, and it pushed him into hanging himself... now this is the one that hit me the hardest. This fuckin thing, it happened a few years ago and I still look at videos and photos of us, sometimes I just lay in bed and stare at the ceiling thinking of the times we’d hang out. This guy was my bestest friend in the whole world, I’d die for this guy, and for him to take his own life because of being gay and resented, it still makes me mad. I was so angry that he didn’t think about me and how it would fuck me up after all these years. EVERYBODY KNEW WE WERE BEST FRIENDS. So as soon as I seen anyone. They hugged me, they cried to me, his family gave me his stuff. I have his sports jerseys. I have some of his clothes. I gave up after this... I really just sat in my car at the baseball field we used to play at and thought to myself, “why can’t it be me for once...”  I don’t even know where to start with this, or end it. I really don’t. Fuck.  

I’ve lost 2 other best friends but not to suicide, to having a jealous girlfriends. My friendships don’t last long, I had a best friend named “A” and we did everything together. She was someone I knew since 7th grade, but we started talking in our grade 12 year, I took her to concerts, she took me to concerts, we’d go sit at the beach and just listen to music and talk about anything. We’d skip school together. But I started dating a girl, and the girl I dated seemed fine for about 7 months. Then she started getting “comfortable.” She got too jealous and would argue with “A” all the time to the point where she just gave up and we haven’t spoken for 2 years. ( until we were both 20 )  in that time I broke up with said Girl, only to try re-establish that relationship with “A” but we’ve moved on and just found different friends. We’re still friends but we don’t talk everyday or do anything together, just the occasional “hey, how are you” 

Recently, Around Christmas 2019, I’m 22, I’ve made a new best friend, her name is “D” she was the closest thing I’ve had to “W” me and D connected so well, she’s the only person other than W that I bought presents for on birthday, valentines and Christmas, when I travelled to other places I’d get her a shirt, souvenirs, just random things that I thought would be funny for her, and she was a “poor” girl, her ffamily  did just enough to barely get by, and I would always help them, so her mother really loved me as well, she lived far about a 15 minute drive from any store, from school, and her work, she doesn’t have her license so she can’t drive and always asked for rides, I’d pick her up from school and later work, because I helped her get a job, but while all this is going on, I have a relationship with the girl I am currently with, we have a child together. So it’s the only reason I stay with her. For some reason out of the blue, she started arguing and trying to physically fight “D” and it ruined stuff since Christmas, I’ve apologized to her and tried to talk to her again, but again... everything good I’ve ever had has to go on me.

Now here I am, venting. It sure helps getting it out there, even if just one person reads this. Thanks for reading. 

I am really sad that it had to go this way, I miss D but she wants nothing to do with me, all I really have is my Daughter. I haven’t spoken to my girlfriend in 2 days because she got mad about a girl I used to date... life is terrible, but people tell me that I need to be strong for my daughter.

Therapy made me feel worse,After one year of therapy I realized that all I could think of were my mental diseases and how I identified myself with it. As a result I stopped the Therapy. The therapy made me stay in my mind and think about only negativ experiences and that is exactly the thing I am trying to escape from. Has anyone of you experienced this before? If so how are you doing on your own now?,1580036548.0,1.0,3
Everyone hates me and I want to die,Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I can’t escape the nagging pain of my brain constantly telling itself that it’s wrong. There is so much shame and guilt and hatred towards myself. I don’t want to be alive. I need to die.,1580036412.0,0.81,1
I want to kill myself to spite my parents,"They ruin everything for me, they are only making my conditions worse. Tonight they cornered me and told me that I had issues when clearly I've been okay for the last 3 months. They are making me relapse into depression.

I can't seem to love people and instead feel mostly numb,"Hi everyone. I'm sorry that this is long. I’ve been reflecting though about my overall life and where my depression likely stems from.

I've thought about some reasons I can’t seem to find anyone (friends, partners). I realized that throughout all these years I’ve been unable to truly “love” people. I’ve even had trouble bonding with my parents from the moment I was taken in. Hell, I can’t even say “I love you” back to family without tensing up or losing my voice. Whether out of the grace of my heart or in a romantic way, I just can’t feel those feelings of love toward people. It’s the reason I’ve never even tried to get a boyfriend and once I did, I broke it off before it even began. I suppose you could say I’m becoming numb to the outside world. I have no friends in real life, any opportunity for love I turn down because I can’t seem to let myself connect with anyone. I always feel like everything is my fault and that I'd be better off not intruding in people's lives, maybe even dying.

My stance toward real relationships is that they don’t phase me and I couldn’t care less about them. I’ve lost interest in human contact. As for empathy, I don’t think I’m utterly lacking, since I do incessantly apologize about anything I do to inconvenience people. It's like two sides of a coin and unpredictable. It's influenced me in ways where I feel like when bad things happen to humanity, I don't feel an overwhelming sense of sadness like I probably should. I feel like its deserved somehow because of everything we do to each other. It's kind of like how you might roll your eyes after watching two people drunkenly fight idiotically then knock each other out. But then on the other hand, if I do anything that can disrupt people's lives I feel like I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't own up to every mistake I made and basically kiss ass.

I don’t know why I can’t feel love for people or bond with them. I'm more afraid of them. All I see is the bad and when I decide to consider the good, it’s like the corruption of human nature overpowers it and I can’t identify a balance. I don’t know if any of this makes sense... I just feel like my own mindset is ruining my chances of feeling anything but isolated and upset. Theres just alot of darkness. I can’t decide if I even want people in my life anymore. A part of me still fears a future without friends or relationships, but then I feel like isolation is where I really belong at the same time. I'm so conflicted and overwhelmed. This life seems so pointless and seems to offer to me nothing but negative feelings and sadness. I wish I could block these thoughts but I'm deciding I guess, to just live with them for now. Sorry if it was too long. I'm sorry if it doesn't belong.",1580036256.0,1.0,3
"Worried about be completely honest in therapy, mainly about (light) recreational substance use.","Before I get into this, I want to note that I haven’t started therapy or talked to my doc about depression. For the past year or so I’ve felt like i have become more and more depressed, but whenever I see my doc or psych (for ADHD every 3 months or so) I say I’m doing fine with a smile, etc. I don’t know why...I think part of it is trying not to be a bother despite knowing it’s their job and the other part is probably denial? Like I said, I don’t know. 

But as the title says, if I were to start going to psychotherapy, I’m worried that I would be hesitant/resistant to being 100% honest with them. 

One part is what I mentioned in the first paragraph, but another part is that I know they’ll ask me about alcohol and drugs. And while my alcohol/drug use may have increased slightly in the past few years (tbh I probably binge drink waaaay less than a few years ago in college), I don’t see it as a cause of my depression. As I have never felt the way I do now in the past. 

My main concern is if I’m honest that I occasionally do recreational drugs (nothing crazy, just some blow now and again on weekends, or X at festivals), will they be weary of me continuing my ADHD meds?

And, again, for what it’s worth, I was doing this stuff prior to feeling this way....which is why I don’t think it’s a potential cause. (Also want to note that I never feel cravings for drugs. I’ll fully admit that if I’m addicted to anything it’s likely alcohol and probably (and reasonably, I’d say) dependent on my ADHD meds). 

(Also, to be completely honest, I was about to close this window and not post because I feel like I’m being extra...and still want to close the window. But this is a throw away account so why not? Anyway though, if I write too long it becomes stream of consciousness and I don’t want that. Any help/thoughts is/are appreciated, but if not, no worries. )",1580036246.0,1.0,6
The hardest part for me...,"Are the good days. They’re hard because I know that they’ll go away and things will go back to shit, or regular in my case I guess. The good days are so few and far in between that I have to do everything I can to savor the day before I lose it and fall back down after being so high. 

My birthday is on Friday and I’ll be 19, I’ll be alone most likely, similar to my other recent birthdays. Don’t believe in wishing or anything but if it was possible I’d wish for the same as all of you, a better life. Doesn’t even need to be perfect, just tolerable I guess. 

The thing I really want though, something we all want, is love. I’ve been having these dreams, dreams I wish I’d never wake from. They feel real but so far away if that makes any sense. Just holding that person in my dreams makes me feel more alive than when I’m awake. It’s a shame that it’ll never be real, I’d do anything to make it real. 

I can’t kill myself, too scared of pain and suffering. If I had a gun I wouldn’t be alive to make this useless post no one will read. I already know the answer but sometimes I really wonder when the pain will end. If the pain will end is a better phrase. Will I find peace and actually want to be awake during the day instead of living in my fantasies? Probably not. The world is grim and I’ve had just about enough of living in it. Hopefully I don’t make it to 19.

I hope you all stay strong.",1580036143.0,1.0,0
Why am I still even here,"

I’m 18 now and I’m sick and tired of hearing it will get better  honestly I’ve been hearing that ever since I was 14 and it seriously never changes honestly I have been destroying my own life ever since. Honestly when I was 14 it was stupid shit to be depressed about I fkn cared about my friends respecting me and being “cool” even though I’ve always been fkn pathetic at talking to people when I was like 15 ive convinced myself I have anxiety and I probably do now but my point is, that since I self diagnosed myself you could guess that I also started self medicating myself and that’s where it honestly went all down hill with the drug use I would take any types of prescription pills  I could get my hands on to numb my feelings when I wasn’t pawing all my stuff I’ve gotten as a kid just to get xans and weed. Can’t you see why I think I’m so pathetic it’s because I am. I honestly have gone so low and my life isn’t even bad. I really don’t hate my life, I hate myself and all the shit I’ve done. And I can’t change, ya I’m off the xans now when I’m broke but honestly just am getting baked all the time but let’s stop talking about what a fkn pathetic drug addict that. The point is that I definitely could’ve made myself a better life but all I’ve ever done was make shitty choices and I could almost literally talk about that shit all day but that’s the past but look where that’s got me, I’m unemployed, playing COD at 4 in the morning with the shitty k/d because I’m to high to react fast enough, I’m just the classic POS. I’ve isolated myself from all my friends ever since 2018, yup I haven’t hung out with nobody for 2 years. I don’t even go out like at all. Honestly I’m not even that lazy I do a lot around the house it’s not like I’m some fat ass sitting around all day eating the groceries and complaining when there’s no snacks.  honestly I’m just to paranoid to even leave the house my self esteem is in the shitter, and trust me I know I’m paranoid cause I’m baked 24/7 but honestly I’m dependent on it to make me forget how depressed I am. It’s honestly a curse don’t smoke weed when your depressed cause if you like it you will end up doing that everyday. I wish I could change and just go get a job, but people suck I know everyone talks shit so I would just be constantly thinking about that cause I hate when people don’t like me, ikr I sound like a self absorbed cunt it’s a disease. No point in telling me I’m a bitch cause I know trust me I know. Sometimes I feel like I got mental health problems but I’m to scared to see a doctor let’s face it I’m basically underweight and have no appetite with fatigue I’m basically just a walking zombie, I don’t say nothing, I don’t have no expression, I’m nothing. I am literally nothing I’ll never fucking change. I realize all I do is sit around and feel bad for myself and hope things get better but never do anything to change them. I just see no fkn point in dropping the weed and dropping everything and moving on. I don’t believe myself I know I can’t do it I’ll go out and find a job but what’s that gonna do me? Drive me more insane with all these thoughts that I make up, make myself some money? I’m
Horrible with money. I’ll just end up saving it have a crisis then go on a bender or who knows. I don’t believe myself to handle the pressure I know I can’t didnt I mention that I know I’m a pussy. I can’t handle any social interactions at all I end up mumbling, studdering, or just saying something that makes me look stupid I don’t have what it takes. So I don’t drive myself to get out of this fkn house I just say fuck it and take a fat popper which is basically tobacco with weed on top and let’s just say that’s destroying my lungs pretty sure it’s gonna give me cancer if I keep doing them but who cares I want to die. Honestly I realize there’s nothing stopping me from going out and getting a job but I’m just a bitch I won’t go through with it. Just hate on me really cause I hate myself I could understand why someone else would hate me. I just want to find peace in life but this whole life is made of stress and I can’t handle any of it I can’t handle anything, bruh I can’t even handle my booze I just drink the whole bottle hoping I won’t wake up and for some reason my
Liver is a stubborn bitch that won’t give out. All I do is make up excuses and feel bad for myself I never change. Honestly I wish I could just give myself a minute and teach me to just not give a fuck and do it but I don’t I’m weak I don’t do anything, that’s why I ask myself “why am I still here?” I have no purpose in life I have no clue why I even considering pushing forward I’ll never change Im always gonna be this way I Midas well just kill my self. I’m sorry for making this so long I should just stop all I’m doing is ranting about what a cunt I am but if you made it this far I appreciate you reading, I’m hoping  that someone could maybe relate to something I’ve said Ik it’s hard to relate to me since I’m basically garbage but I hope I’m not the only that’s been here or idk I just hope someone reads this at all I know nobody wants to hear any of this bs thank you so much if you read any of this I know I’m just a broken record but if you did thank you",1580036093.0,1.0,3
I think I'm depressed again,"I've been dating my boyfriend, who's 21, for over a year now. 10 of those months it was a long distance relationship. I moved states to be with him. I left all my family and friends behind. We live in a four bedroom house with four roommates and three dogs.

He loves to have sex. He's very forceful when it comes to sex. When I'm not in the mood he doesn't care and forces me into it. He hurt me really bad one time and made me bleed. Whenever he doesn't want sex I can't get him to budge. Sometimes he'll tell me that we can have sex if I give him a blowjob or a handjob. After I give him one he changes his mind and is too tired now.

We both work. I usually get one day off a week. He's scheduled to work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The rest of the days are over time and he decides whether or not he wants to go in. He works 14 hour shifts while I work 8 or 9 hours. Most of the time he doesn't go in on the weekdays. I'll be at work and I see on snapchat that he's going out with our roommates to do things. (They're males too) they go out to eat and go to the movies. When I get home from work I want to go out with him too, but now he's too tired to do anything and heads straight to bed. I feel left out when he does that.

I talked to him about it yesterday after work. He said that I'm just making things up. He then told me that he's flying across the country to California to meet up with one of our roommates. He's going for four days and without me. I feel so sad, lonely, and angry. We never do anything together anymore. He leaves for California today after work. I won't be able to see him when leaves and he already left for work.

Pointless.,"This is kinda long, so don’t feel like you have to stick around. TW for suicidal thoughts and mentions of suicide. 

Okay so I’ve been struggling with depression for over a year and a half now, most of it in slumps with a few weeks reprieve every few months. 

It’s been really bad this past week. At least 10 times a day I have suicidal thoughts. They’re nothing I would act on, they’re just annoying and hard to get rid of. It would hurt my mom too much if I did commit suicide. But I’m so tired of living like this. 

You see, I thought I had situational depression because I was in a transitional period of my life, but now that I’m settled I feel worse. I’ve achieved so many things in the last 8 months. I’ve made it into my dream school, figured out how to afford it, moved to a different country, made amazing new friends, everything I’ve been working towards for years, but I’m still depressed. 

I have no reason to be! I want to be content so damn badly! I should be! I now realize that I, in all likeliness, have major depressive disorder. And I hate that so much! I don’t want to deal with it. I just want it to go away.

I’ve been thinking really bad thoughts. If I can’t be happy here, can I be happy anywhere? What’s even the point then, if life is just this endless struggle?

I know there are many people in my life who care for me so much. They are one of the major reasons why I won’t kill myself. That, and I could never bare someone having to find my dead body. It would be wrong of me to burden and traumatize someone like that.

I also haven’t told anyone my depression is this bad. I’ve hinted to some friends that I struggle occasionally. A few know I’m depressed, but that “I’m working on it!”. Usually I’m high-functioning depressed, meaning I’m good at acting like I’m not and not worrying anyone around me. I’m still like that, but it’s been harder for me to do the little things lately. It took me five hours to work up the motivation to take a shower today. And that’s with already being three days overdue for one. 

I hinted to a friend about a year ago (when I was also suicidal) that I was having those thoughts. It was late at night, I was already on the defensive because my relationship with her was pretty rocky, so no other conversations came from it. 

I really wish I could delete myself from existence, and nobody would remember who I was. Then my death wouldn’t impact anyone.

I’m just afraid that one day the burden of staying alive for the sake of other people will become too much for me to bare, and I’ll off myself anyways. I’m a far way from that sort of drastic measure, but I could see it happening someday.

I know I should get help, but 

1. I’m a broke college student. Even though therapy appointments are slightly discounted, I don’t have the money. I already pay a lot as an international student, I don’t have the money for more. Also, psychological support at my school is terrible.

2. My mom. Her father killed himself a few years ago. They were estranged, but it hit her hard. Now she blames victims of suicide and calls them selfish while masquerading as a mental health advocate. I could never ever tell her that I am going through this. It would break her.

3. My mom, but for another reason. She’s the opposite of a mental illness denier. She actually convinced me I had depression when I was taking a lot of naps in 7th grade. She got the doctor to give me antidepressants because she had convinced me and the doctor I was depressed. Looking back, I was not depressed, at all. The first time I was every depressed for real was my sophomore year of high school, they were radically different feelings. I think I was just tired from staying up super late reading. She’s already really worried about me being in a foreign country, I can’t give her another reason to worry. I can handle this without her worrying.

I’m not looking for advice really, I know what needs to be done (find help), but I’m not likely to do that anytime soon for the reasons mentioned above. I just needed someone to listen to my story, because I’ve never been able to tell it and to be vulnerable like this.

I've been wondering about a lot of things. How this world is so unfair to us. There's no happy ending. And I dont expect an happy ending. Its just all the debt and loans are getting to me.  Why is it fair that some people get to enjoy life and others don't? Where is karma?? Again, I know its irrational but it keeps gnawing at me, how the world keeps saying life is great but its not.


I know I can weather it out, survive it, but....what's the point??? 


I mean, I know I'm no good son nor a good friend. I am terrified of having a kid who's just like me, one who is..................weird and having depression

I'm just sorry for a lot of things. I know I can be a bit of an ass, I am truly sir about that.",1580033919.0,0.81,12
I have spent so long wanting to die I have forgotten how to live.,"I have had severe depression since early childhood and I am now 29. I am not medicated and nor do I go to therapy. I did once and stopped after a year. I am in a way more balanced place than when I was when I was say 18 but the survival techniques and self taught unhealthy habits prevent me from progressing further. 

My main issue is my lack of caring, I taught myself to stop giving a f++k about anything a long time ago as it made life way easier but now I have become so good at it I struggle to commit to things like friends, studies and a career. I struggle to maintain happiness and I flit between things, doing what at that time makes me happy and when it stops doing that I just quit it. Be it friends or whatever. I can walk away from anything easily and without care.

I have no career prospects as I didn't study. I don't even want to do anything. I just want to be left alone. I cannot be bothered either with studying to get a better job because I don't see the point. I never expected to be alive at this age so never planned for what to do now. I am in unfamiliar territory. 

I spent so long wanting to die that I never learned or considered how it was to live. My boyfriend tells me what was broke can be fixed but I dunno. I feel like my mental tool box is empty and all that is left is the blueprints of unfulfilled suicides.",1580033671.0,0.81,1
Purpose,"I’m really not sure if I do have depression but for the past year or so I have been having increased phases of sadness that I believe, after much reflection, originate from a lack of purpose and direction in life.
My wife and I have been together for many years and we do not want to have children, we have pretty standard office jobs that we like to complain about. I am quite introverted and dislike social situations, particularly with larger groups of people and often need to drink in order to handle being somewhere out of my comfort zone.
It has finally reached a tipping point where my wife is tired of me complaining about having to attend these social situations.
I never say that I don’t want her to go out and would happily let her go without me but it’s obviously going to end badly for our relationship if we live such separate lives and I become increasingly alone.
I don’t know how to break free of my lack of confidence and self doubt in social situations and get out of this sadness. I need to find a purpose in life but just can’t find anything.",1580033530.0,0.81,2

One Year Later,"I feel silly so I'm venting this where no one in my family will see it. Violence TW below. 

My aunt's husband was an alcoholic and an addict, and could be a very mean drunk sometimes. We all knew - so the general rule was he didn't overdo it. If he did, he and my aunt dealt with it and that was that. We all loved him and supported him anyway, because he was, for all his flaws, a good, kind, caring person - he just had vices and got into trouble when he overdid it. Last year, they got in a fight where he accused her of cheating. She walked out, and eventually, a few days later, went back to get her dog. He tried to choke her out and she called the cops. He was drunk and, we think, high.

Looking back we think he realized that was his big fuckup - my aunt would leave him, his son would want nothing to do with him. He slit his wrists with a box cutter. The cops say he charged at them with it. My aunt says he didn't. They tazed him and shot him three times in the back. The coroner ruled it a homicide and the officer that shot him got officer of the year for protecting his buddies.

All of this aside, I'm having a really hard time processing all of this. To me he was just uncle K. He was a goofy, funny metalhead that loved Slayer, starting mosh pits, and supporting his son's thrash metal band. He and my aunt were like a second set of parents to me when I was living with my emotionally abusive grandparents (they lived in the downstairs apartment and I'd regularly go hang out with them). Their son, who just turned 21, is like my (22F) little brother. He proposed to his girlfriend on New Years. K loved watching Supernatural (they played Carry On Wayward Son at his funeral). He unflinchingly supported me even when it meant my grandparents kicked him and my aunt out of the house for calling them out on their shit. For all his flaws, he needed help. Not a bullet. 

My aunt is doing okay. She's dating. She's doing okay at trying to move on. So I feel silly for the fact that I'm sitting here, unable to go a day without thinking about him. Maybe it's because we both had depression and were too proud or too scared to speak up about it much? I don't know. I just know that not a day goes by that I don't think about him, and I feel like I'm not - entitled to that, maybe? Like I wasn't in a position where I should be so affected. I know it's stupid.

He thought no one would care if he was gone and no one would show up at his funeral. It was a packed house all day. I think about him every single day. I miss him so much.",1580032618.0,0.81,0
Do the professionals really care?,"Sometimes I get weird stares from the professionals I talk to, like they're judging me for whatever weird thing or thought I've just said. It makes me alienated.

They're just going about their daily business, listening to us, diagnosing us, throwing some meds to make us satisfied etc.",1580032486.0,0.84,5

Why are we like this?,"What is it about depression to makes our skin crawl to even THINK about telling someone that our suicidal thoughts and ideations cloud our brain until it’s all we know?

It feels like those feelings get stronger and stronger everyday and that I lose rational thinking more and more. But on the flip side, I don’t want to bother my friends, family, fiancé about it because it’s my own fucking fault anyway. I shouldn’t bring them down just because I fucked up. 

But did i? Yes I did. Maybe. I don’t know. 

But no one needs to know. It’s safer to keep those thoughts to myself. It’s safer to be a danger to myself than a burden to others. It’s safer to keep my friends and family at bay, so maybe i won’t hurt them.",1580032267.0,0.81,1

Wasted my teenage years and now it’s too late.,"3 months ago I turned 18 and realized how immature I am compared to my peers. I’ve never been to a party, I’ve never had a grilfriend (I’m short and ugly), I still don’t have my driver license, no real friends, no skills, talents or hobbies. I recently overheard two guys my age talking about all the crazy stuff they did in middle school and I was extremely jealous. So many regrets and so much wasted time. The worst thing is I can’t go back in time and fix it. It’s too late. I didn’t even go to my prom becuase of anxiety and depression. I was thinking about purposely failing at my school so I will repeat the entire year just so I can get another year at high school and second chance but by doing that I would bring shame to my family. 

Even if I got a girlfriend it wouldn’t be the same. Everyone has relationship and sex expierence since they were 14 and I won’t catch up. And I will never expierence the teenage love. It hurts so much.  And it pisses me off when people say that teenage love isn’t perfect and I didn’t miss anything. It like telling a starved African child that McDonald’s food isn’t that good and he shouldn’t eat it.

I tried to ignore the past but to be honest the future doesn’t look good either. I can’t imagine myself having a job. I’m lazy and stupid. I barely went through high school. I’m thinking about ending it all every day. I have millions of health issues and I feel like I’m going to kill myslef anyway in a few years so why not now when I’m still remembered fondly by my family.",1580032008.0,0.93,14

Hi. I’m bipolar one and currently severely depressed. Looking for manic folk to remind me it’s not always awful.,"Or, you know, people with depression who feel ok more often than not. I’m feeling pretty down. Also definitely currently manic to a pretty serious degree. 30y/o. Recently Became unemployed by choice due to a stressful work environment(kitchen).  Wonderful girlfriend but I think I’m getting on her nerves. Almost 8 years in and every day I just act like a dick then think “that probably did it, now you’re really fucked.” But there she is to pick up the pieces and try to help me grow as a man. 

We’re definitely codependent on some level but when it’s good it’s fuckin sunshine and rainbows. Then we wind up depressed at the same time. Sometimes it’s because I can’t snap out of it and drag her down. Rarely, the opposite. The mania mostly just makes me feel an uncomfortable energy and I get irritable. Sometimes I feel like I could conquer the world. Mostly just irritable. We both have issues sleeping on any sort of schedule. She is someone I depend on heavily, and has had issues with anxiety as long as I’ve known her(and before by her accounts). Beyond that her only current substance issues are prescribed. ADD meds and a weak benzo. I just drink and we both smoke weed. 

I know I’ll be ok. Technically. I’m just so goddamn sick of being tired. Sick of not being able to hold a job I don’t hate. Sick of being too bored and apathetic to move so all I focus on is physical pain or shitty memories. I should work on my music. My writing. Find a job. All I feel is hopeless. What’s even the point?

I’m 30. I’ve been to a psychiatrist and hated every med they gave me. Any bipolar folks find success with something atypical? Seroquel makes me a zombie. Lithium makes me legitimately suicidal(as in I might actually act vs just the fantasy or cry for help bs). Asenapine(brand name Saphris) helped greatly for a short time before convincing Medicaid to accept became too much of a hassle. Going off of it on a short taper produced no negative side effects that I noticed, although my drinking increased. I cannot day for sure if these events were actually related as I was going through a very tumultuous period and have a long history of alcoholism. I come back to NYC after a year trying to go back to school. Fail out a again and upon return work BS job after BS job from December 2016 to maybe last May?Get job that pays well. Social life gone. 6 days a week. 55+ hours on a good week. Saturday’s are 9am-12pm. Then back at 9 the next day. Couldn’t hack it. So much for being a chef. 

Now what? Start an entry level gig in IT? Try to get into the plumber’s union? Electrician? Try to worm my way into a corporate position? I need to lock down something with a career path. I’m still not 100% on bio kids but if I’m going to raise children I HAVE to adopt at least one. She agreed to that a few years ago. 

Rambling. Manic. Stupid and pointless. If you read the whole thing, you’re a sweetheart. Idk if anyone can identify with any of this beyond the “vaguely similar” experience but even that would help to hear. I’m considering meds again but goddamn, I don’t wanna get fat and if I go into zombie mode I might just not be able to fight it anymore. I don’t wanna settle for a boring personality just so that I don’t keep fucking up my relationships with everyone around me.

Embarrassed in what I use as reasons to live.,"Singing makes me feel human.

I have loved the idea of writing and performing music, and had it central to my identity, since early childhood. Having a good sense of pitch to sing in key was a confidence boost--I can remember feeling so insecure and alien even when I was learning how to add and subtract.

Fast forward to now, and a band I grew up listening to is going to put on a concert in my hometown in a few months. I have a ticket but will likely go by myself. I'm by myself so much now, so it'll be okay.

This concert is one of just a couple things I'm holding onto so I can survive right now. I don't have a plan for how I can continue to tackle the monotony and chaos of a world I cannot process the logic of after they come and go. That is what I am embarrassed about... I struggle to just live for myself, though I hear that suggested to me so much. I interpret that as taking care of myself more, which I have a goal for. Aside from that though... I'm trying not to think of anything too dark, but after all this time, each step forward feels like it lands on a bed of spikes.

I don't even want to sing that much anymore, and without that part of me I'm lost.",1580028997.0,0.76,3
They make getting back out there sound easy,"Getting back ”out there” is not easy.It’s so hard and it sucks. It's awkward and it leaves you with even more questions. It's almost as if when depressions gloom is at bay, the wrath of anxiety comes along to trip you up. 


I was invited to lunch a while ago and almost as soon as I made the commitment I realized I didn’t want to go. Made it out of my bed and was able to get ready but I was already running a little late. On my way I realized I’d left my phone behind. Ran back to get it because I needed it to contact people. Messaged the people and got the response that “person X say to come”... which to me sounded a lot like “ I don’t want you to come but she does”... 

Eventually made it to the restaurant about 30mins late. I had to endure the awkwardness of being guilted into feeling bad for being late. I felt bad and in my haste I’m not 100% sure I was able to convey a sincere apology but I’m sure I said sorry. It was awkward as hell and the demon on my shoulder was murmuring , “You should have stayed home”, “ Did you think you could get away from me?,” “You can run but you can’t hide”, “These people don’t know you at all do they?”....


So I wonder? Can people tell? Are they completely oblivious? Do they really just not care? I’m going through IT! OK? Yes I’m was late, and I often am because I can’t bear to get up. Getting out of bed is the biggest challenge I face everyday. So, I’m pretty proud of myself. I’m proud because I spent all morning trying to get up. I cried for most of the morning but still managed to get up. You were really worked up about me being late but can you not see? Can you really not see? I'm here sitting across the table from you...

What if she didn't have a daughter that can't do shit? The look on her face when she sees my cuts hurts more than any method of self harm possible. I try so hard to improve myself and my mental health, but at this point, just being in the same house with me is toxic enough. I wish she can run away, leave all her troubles behind and just start anew. She deserves way more than what she has now, her love and her passion for others would've gotten her so much farther than where she is now. There is still so much she wants to accomplish, yet I'm weighing her down from doing anything she wants to do.

About 1 / 20 of such even mention this anywhere on their sites or their psychologytoday profile thing, and even then there’s no way to filter based on that.

Even outside of that the whole task is incredibly daunting. Like I apparently need to know ahead of time the subtleties of different degrees and specializations. And the types of therapy, the types!

"Struggling with mental health after abuse... very lost in life, looking for advice","24 F

I got out of an abusive relationship about 6 months ago, but I still struggle all the time. He was extremely emotionally abusive and sometimes sexually abusive for over a year. I was very isolated and he was all I knew for a long time and I'm trying really hard to recover.

I'm feeling very lost in life for a number of reasons. I have PTSD, depression, and anxiety. A lot of this is from the abuse. On top of that I have a lot of other stresses in my life and lot of negative feelings towards myself. I went to school at a nice university for a while for Global Studies. I didn't like it so I stopped and got my cosmetology license. I did that for a year and then got bored of that. Now I have been in school for a year again for Computer Science. I am decent at it but I still don't feel it's something I really see myself doing, but I feel it's too late for me to try something else, and my depression is so crippling I have a very hard time with school at the minute.

Everything compounds on each other. I feel like a failure because I can't figure out what I want to do with my life. I haven't finished a degree and all my peers are in their career jobs. I want to push myself to finish this degree but I'm not necessarily happy in it and half the time I'm too depressed to go to class or do my work (because of feeling like a failure and because of the abuse). All my negative feelings are so cyclical and I start to shut down.

It's hard for me to function a lot of the time. I don't eat well anymore and my room is always a mess, sometimes I have a hard time even showering. My parents know I'm depressed because I'm in therapy but they don't know the extent of any of it or really any of my feelings, they also don't know I was abused. I don't feel like I can tell them about my struggles with school because I feel like a massive disappointment and it just makes me want to disappear. I wish I could just be a normal person and function fine and know what I wanted to do and do school well. I know I'm smart enough but I'm just a huge fucking failure.

I spend most of my time playing video games with online friends and it is the only thing that really makes me feel okay. I know it's mostly a distraction and it probably doesn't help because I am just avoiding real life and not taking care of myself.

I asked my mom to come see my tomorrow (she lives a 2.5 hr drive away) and she's meeting me for brunch and we're gonna spend the day together. I know it would probably help to open up to her but I have no idea what to say and I'm petrified to tell her about the abuse. Every time she asks me how I'm feeling I just try to end the conversation.

I'm not a danger to myself but most of the time I do wish I could just not exist. I don't know how to cope with any of this. Everything feels too big to even take baby steps.

I can't get myself to reply to these women (some of whom look like quality humans). I just scroll Reddit instead.

Luckily I'm also prescribed some ADHD meds so that gets me through the work day. Actually crushing it there. 

I know this isn't a tough problem like most folks in here have (been there my friends, please know I'm with you in spirit, it's not garaunteed to get better but it can). Does anyone have advice? I do poorly outside of relationships. And dating would force me to leave the apartment which would be helpful for the depression.",1580026491.0,1.0,0

Shitty 2019 ending - 2020 remains shitty,"Hi Reddit,

Im new here so please bare with me. The ending of 2019 was a shitty way to end my year. A close friend (very imporant person) passed away near the ending of 2019. Arranging his funeral was stressful as fuck. His family is a mess and could care less about his arrangements for his funeral.

I have dealt with ""sadness"" for a long time in my life. I've always felt like I have a noose in my neck and sometimes it feels like im hanging. My friends passing made this feeling worse. I also thought I found love but this person pushed me away as soon as I showed signs of affection. Turns out this person confessed to be borderline sociopath. That scared me.

I drink, its my outlet. I engage in non commited relationahips willingly. I use sex as a coping mechanism, it never feels better but that is obvious to expect. I am distant from people and have become slowly more negative than the usual. I find myself becoming manipulative and cold. Suicide thoughts are hard to avoid, I dont think I will commit to because I am a coward and also have commitment issues. 

I have ADD, I am depressed, have low selfesteem, average standers and as time passes the cloud over my head is getting darker and darker. So have my personality. I used to be a sweet, loving, happy individual and now I am a fraction of that.

I don't know who to reach out to. I just want advise and be heard.",1580026014.0,1.0,0
Can it be night forever?,"I want it to be night forever. Everybody on this is Earth sleeps while I be the one up. So that nobody can see how I actually want to feel/be.

I want to be were nobody can see me suffer, just like it is at this moment. Next, I wake up in the middle of the road and see my car that's been wrecked. Seeing that it's night so I'm back to the endless loop. I mean that's what depression feels like anyways.",1580025993.0,0.98,7
I hung out with my friends today but I still felt empty and something was holding me back.,"Friends asked me to hang out today. It's been a while and I've been feeling low. We hung out until 2 AM. It was great. I had a good time. I was out! But I felt sad still? I don't know why? I had much less energy than them and it showed. So I put some effort into it but I felt drained. If everyone else can have fun carelessly why does it feel like so much work for me? Something felt wrong and I just wanted to fade away from them. Nothing bad even happened! At one point my depression was telling me ""you're not fun anymore, don't hang out with them anymore until you're normal"" or ""you're boring.""

I made my mother cry......,"If there's one thing in life that keeps me going in this wretched world it's my mother, she's been here supporting me all this time, she's been with me every time I take therapy, I've known her ever since I was born. She was depressed too, had to be confined, my grandma called her crazy and after her depression she still kept calling her names, I've seen what's she's been through, she watched our house burn down while she was inside, and never cried nor was mad that she was badmouthed by my father's mother, nor has she given up when my father kept scolding her, she kept me and my brother happy every day kept up with my family's bullshit.......to think I would make her cry..... To think that the useless piece of trash I am would dare let her cry after all she's been through, just because if what happened to me....I don't know how to deal with it, I've failed myself and her.....just because of my own selfish anger and stupidity I made my reason to keep going, to free her and make her happy, it makes me walk closer to death's bitter-sweet embrace",1580025616.0,1.0,1
Lost the will to live. No one understands.,"Today I finally told my dad and step mom that I've been depressed to the point of not being able to get out of bed for days. I said I wanted to talk to someone about it. They responded in anger. My dad says ""You can talk to us you dont need anyone else"". My step mom blames me feeling bad on almost entirely my sleep schedule. I feel like they think it's an easy fix. ""You just need to work out"", ""you feel bad because you dont do anything"", ""we been telling you to do these things for years"". Well guess what. I've been depressed for years. They are afraid of depression. They don't understand it. When they respond in self blame and anger.. it's just crushing. And it's all my fault. 

When they started guilting me about being so sad that I wish I was dead, I ran upstairs and grabbed my bookbag and keys because I was just gonna leave. Didnt want to listen to them ask me where they ""went wrong"". As I was putting my shoes on I just started crying and shaking uncontrollably and my legs gave out. I was having super fast and deep breathing. That has never happened to me before, and my parents weren't helping at all. Idk what it was. I just broke down and I probably looked really really bad. After that they seemed slightly more concerned..... lol. 

It doesn't help that I can never ever express myself the way I want. I can never just say what I want because I get super choked up. Anytime I'm truthful about my situation it's just painful. All I can do is cry. I scare myself. I know that if my life keeps up this way that I'll eventually do something. One of these nights my strength will all be depleted, and I will leave peacefully. It's a gut feeling I guess. Feels inevitable sometimes.

At night when I'm high I often lay down and listen to music. It's practically all I do anymore. I feel a deep emptiness. And loneliness. I can't connect with anyone. And the people I DO connect with dont like me anymore. Everyone hates me. I feel horrible for being a shit friend. 

I'm an unreliable, lazy, hopeless peice of shit. If I had a gun right now I'd fucking shoot myself. Just like my great grandfather did. I just wish it wouldn't effect anyone else. I'm so selfish.

No I wasn't nude and see asked did I have shirtless pics of myself on my phone and I panicked and said yes but then I lied about the pics and asked did she get the one I sent her knowing full well I didn't. Then she asked am I seeing someone or at who was I sending them to. We share a phone plan but I let her her go thru my phone.

"Just finally realized why my ex won’t ever get back with me, even though it was there the whole time","This happened this summer... So my ex was seeing other people, we weren’t exclusive by any means but I really wanted to be. She had just gotten out of a long-term relationship and wasn’t ready to be exclusive with anyone at the time. I wasn’t really okay with that but I tried it, and I eventually called her while having a breakdown because I’m a weak fuckboy who couldn’t handle it. She said that we should stop dating, and I agreed. Worst decision of my life, letting her walk away. Three days later my Skype status says something along the lines of “Wishing you would change for the both of us” or some absolute bull crap I was spouting because, again, I’m a weak little fuck who cries like a bitch when he doesn’t get his way... she saw and screenshotted it. Up until then she wanted to get back with me, I heard. She let it stew for about a week, filled with her crying and angry no doubt, and unleashed her fury upon me in a video chat which left me a driveling mess. I then grabbed a knife from my gun cabinet, played “Let You Down” by NF at max volume, and almost slit my wrists. I threw the knife because I couldn’t do it. A week later my mom finds it, big fight, and I feel like absolute shit all over again. My two most important women in my life both hated me. 

Fast forward to now, past a shitton of drama and me taking a break, we made amends and are now good friends. Lately haven’t been talking as much since she’s bogged down with work. But I’ve been wracking my brain for months trying to figure out why she never chose me, now that she’s settled down again with a live-in boyfriend who gives her everything she needs and more, who is twice the man I am... and that’s because I wanted her to change and be exclusive with me when she wasn’t ready. And I couldn’t handle that. I can’t handle it. That’s what they’ll put on my fucking gravestone. I couldn’t handle it. Because I literally get anal about everything in life.

"Getting back on my feet but feeling hopeless, 20 year old male"," 

So I've got very severe insomnia, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. I've had it pretty hard the past few years - outside of 10 years of severe physical and psychological domestic abuse, through the past four years I've witnessed my mother die in front of me, had both grandfathers and my sister pass, and just got out of a physically, psychologically, and sexually abusive relationship - yes, with a woman.

I've been taking my anti-depressants for a while now, and I don't know if getting out of that 4 and a half year relationship, or the Lexapro or the grace of God or whatever is making me feel this way, but I feel okay. The negative thoughts aren't really here anymore, I don't feel suicidal as much. I don't cry to Videotape and imagine the song set to my funeral.

Basically, I'm getting back on my feet, but I'm feeling extremely downtrodden, hopeless, and... ashamed of my situation. I went to college for the past 2 and a half years, and I got academically dismissed last semester, which I've come to terms with because my situation was pretty extreme and I had genuine medical illnesses with a documented suicide attempt and I was rushing through something I didn't need to - it was simply a recipe for disaster. I know they will let me back in and I am working on my application for re-entry, but now that I'm back in the ""real world"", I'm feeling hopeless.

After the semester ended we took a trip to California to spread my sister's ashes in La Jolla where my mom is resting. I decided to take this ""winter break"" to breathe, collect myself, and deal with the break-up that I was going through at the time (4 and a half years doesn't sound like much, but it was a quarter of my life, in perspective). In the past month and a half I've lost 10 pounds (not overweight, but put on the freshman 15 - used to lift weights constantly, getting back in shape), and I've been applying for jobs, but I just feel like I'm set back so bad and I'm not going to make it back into society. I had jobs concurrently from December 2016-December 2018, but the past year was so bad that I only worked a shit job during the Summer, in between full course loads.

I'm not young, but I'm not old, I'm 20 - so these are all entry level jobs. Cashier/Cook, Grocery Stocker, Cinema Worker, and a Captioning Assistant. I'm afraid basically that people are going to look at my resume that I'm submitting and think I'm just some dumb spoiled kid not worth their time, that a 20 year old should have much more experience and be much more adjusted to the real world. I'm afraid that I've wasted so much time that it's just too late for me and they'll think ""oh, this is just some dumb college kid, let him go into debt and work at McDonald's"". I'm just terrified of the thought of all this time being wasted and my worth being nothing, everything having gone to waste these past few years to the point of no return. I want to go up where I see the others climb, and I finally feel like I have that capacity, but I just don't know if it's going to happen.

For an example of how I'm feeling... this girl I'm seeing manages this place (entry level position, both her job and the one I applied for \[GameStop\]). I have a lot of money from inheritance, I'm not going to disclose how much but it's enough for me to live comfortably for probably 10 or so years, but I feel like a fucking loser ass bum because of the fact that I fucked up in school and I don't have a job and if I get the job here she's going to be managing me. We reconnected after 2 or so years and she's living on her own, albeit things aren't going... swimmingly for her, she's done all this, and I've just breezed through school, attempted suicide, had shitty shit happen and bode my time away.

I don't know how to describe this other than... I finally hit the surface, but everyone else is in a boat. Or, I fall from a burning plane into the ocean, and I'm on the wing, floating to an island, hopeful... and I just get eaten by sharks.

I keep constantly regretting everything I do and who I am and it is stopping me from doing anything at all. Everyday I would spend most of the time just hating myself and I can't even concentrate in my hobbies or a chat with my family.
Everything seems so wrong lately that I just keep asking myself why I can't change even if I try. I don't want to kill myself but I just can't stop on figuring out ways of throwing myself towards death without making the only thing that keeps me alive feeling sad. I want to stop feeling this way but I'm unable to even ask for help again, because I just kept receiving the same answer again and again.""dont be sad"" like if I haven't tried every fk day I try to sleep without crying. I don't know what to do at all. I just want to stop thinking this way, but no matter how hard I try another problem took the space of the other and it would go on all day long. I can't even think properly about it now, it's like if I kept hitting my head against a church bell and no matter what I do it won't stop.",1580020142.0,0.72,1
I want love so I will never get it,"I feel like if the miracle I’m hoping for happens and I find love, which I’m not even sure is real anymore, I will ruin it. Whoever it may be, I’ll never want to let go of them. I’ll want to hold them in my arms and mine, forever and they’ll run away because I love them too much. I will never find true love because I think love is not real in my life. I will never feel that wholeness, that warmth, that hope and that bond again. Just time to suck it up and keep going through the motions until I die. It’s so depressing I want to laugh at it, just because of how pathetic it is. But it’s my reality.

I’m so lonely, but that will never change.. because my heart is desiring something that is only in my mind. It wants love so badly.. but it will never get it because now it wants love so badly that nothing will be enough",1580020112.0,1.0,3

Should I talk to my parents,I haven’t told them much of anything regarding my depression and everything but last night I relapsed into cutting again and had a panic attack.

the key to fixing depression.,"I'm a very depressed individual, I've been depressed as far back as I can remember.  I've attempted suicide a few times didn't succeed though.  as I get older my worldview on existing has changed.  but learn how to deal with my depression by thinking about it and understanding it from a personal perspective as opposed to an objective perspective.  I break down my depression into steps.  I identify what I can control and what I can't.  from what I've identified that I can control, I tried to control it so that it contributes positively to the things that I cannot control.  my depression is biochemical in nature meaning I do not control how I feel but rather I control what I can do.  like you may not feel you will be successful at anything but you can still attempt to be successful.  you may not feel like you can get up and take care of yourself but you still can physically do those things.  once you're able to separate your impetuous or your drive from the emotional component then being able to function becomes easier.  it's a type of autopilot but it keeps you going when you want to quit.  the truth is life never gets better but there are moments in our lives that we truly enjoy despite all the pain around it and I think that is one of the true purposes of living and we have to try to experience that and share it with other people.  if you're biologically depressed like me, life will never get better but we can keep it from getting worse and we can bring up our quality of life to a point where it's bearable.  and maybe when life becomes bearable one can find their purpose.  having purpose makes it easier as I found that once I started trying to live like a good human being life became worth it in the little moments.",1580019071.0,1.0,0

I Get Angry When My Mom Says “I Love You”,"Growing up, my mom was extremely controlling and manipulative. Whenever I talk to her, now, I get angry because it always transports me right back to my childhood. I try to have a relationship with her and hold conversations. But it seems like I can’t talk about anything without her either ignoring me or criticizing me. Even when she says “I love you” it makes me furious because the way she says it sounds so fucking manipulative. It’s hard to explain to other people.

Just a tip from experience,"if you are going through a low episode, I don’t need to tell you that you’re probably not in a rational mindset. You might be thinking about texting that certain person and “coming clean” about your feelings or telling someone off or anything that might seem rash if your were in a normal mindset. And it might seem like if you did that it would help, maybe get you passed this hump, be a quick fix. Before you do that, describe exactly what you’re thinking about in writing. Reading it back might clear some of the cloudiness and help you see the rational side of things a little clearer. It really helps me, and God knows this would have saved me some weird embarrassments that ended up just prolonging the low episode.

An epiphany about forgiveness,"Sometimes forgiveness from others will never come. That opportunity may never arise and so we are left with all the guilt, shame, pain, and every other emotion and feeling that surround the ordeal. 

So where does that leave us? 

When we want an opportunity to earn that forgiveness. To be given a shot at redemption in their eyes. 

We are carrying all of this pain and will be stuck with it till we decide to forgive ourselves. 

If they aren’t gonna give us that chance then we must let it go regardless of what happened. 

I know that sounds simple but it’ll be difficult.

So from today onward I’m going to try and forgive myself and never allow  what happened to happen to another person in my life. 

I will always be sorry for what happened but I can not let this consume my life to the point that I take my own life because of it.",1580017720.0,1.0,1

Is It Normal to React to Positivity This Way,"I've realized lately that I hate when people react to me saying I'm not feeling well/feeling depressed with sympathy and even positive sentiments. For some reason it makes me almost angry when someone sends me wholesome memes or cute videos and stuff in an attempt to cheer me up or make me feel a little better. I'm also peeved when people tell me they hope I feel better soon. Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me?

I'm not sure exactly why I feel like this and I don't know if ""angry"" is even the right word to describe the feeling I get. Like I mostly just get this way when it's one of my friends who's neurotypical and doesn't understand that I'll look at the meme/video/whatever and maybe smile for 2 seconds and then go back to being depressed because my brain is literally not producing serotonin properly.

I think maybe a part of me also feels like they're being condescending for some reason. The rational part of my brain knows that my friends care about me and just want me to feel better, but the other part of me is like mega cynical I guess and feels like they're just sending me stuff so I'll just shut up about being depressed.

Am I the only one that thinks this way? Is all of this another symptom of depression or am I feeling like this because of something else?",1580017601.0,0.86,1
I don’t even know why I want to have friends anymore,"I’ve tried to have friends and I thought that they considered me a good friend of some people at one point in their lives. I thought I would have some respect from them. But as I have found out, I only matter to my family.

I really don’t like my family no matter how much they love me. I don’t feel as much love from them as I did before. I don’t feel love for them as much anymore. I don’t think I feel great emotion for them.

My “friends” don’t talk to me outside of school. I have paid for them, given them rides to and from school, and I have let them into my house. And I still don’t see them repay those favors for me. I only see people who talk about me behind my back and people who are fake to my face saying I’m their friend. 

I don’t know what I want to do with my life anymore. I don’t want to keep living in this world where I’m not important to my peers. I don’t and to live in this world where nobody loves me beside my family. I don’t want to live in a world where I don’t see myself in its future.

[19F] Need help with low moods before period,"Hello! Apologies if this post is not appropriate for this sub, I just really need some help figuring it out. 

Since my early teens I've struggled with both depression and anxiety. There was a lot going on, things I couldn't handle, and it all got very bad. In recent years I'm getting better, I'm more familiar with causes or triggers and more able to manage myself to an extent. 

However I've noticed that time and time again I am most prone to feeling depressed between 1-2 weeks before I get my period. It doesn't always occur, but when it does it can get quite severe. This isn't just feeling moody or emotional or a little upset. I get some of the most severe feelings of depression I've ever experienced without any logical cause or things in life going badly, other than the only connection being that I get my period shortly after. 
It may last a couple of days up to a whole week at this severe level. But almost always as soon as I get my period I start to feel significantly better than I was and more like myself. 

I am aware that this is probably something to discuss with a doctor. But I want to hear about others who have experienced a similar thing,  or maybe some tips to help manage it. 

Admittedly I am afraid to discuss it with a doctor until I have a few occasions that I've tracked it. I'm just started a mood tracker this year and will use that. But I know if I see the doctor they'll likely need to know exactly when it's happened, how long, and how bad it is.",1580016237.0,1.0,8
I’m scared of death but I want to kill myself,"I’m 22 years old, since I was 13 I was diagnosed with major Depression, I was given medication and once in a while I take them. But they never seem to help, it’s been 10 years now and I think about suicide every day. I’m scared of death. But I still just want to either drive into on coming traffic or shoot myself with my gun. 

My parents split when I was 9 and my grandfather raised me. He died of brain cancer 2 years ago and since then my best friend hung himself, and I just feel so god damn empty. 

I have a daughter and a very terrible girlfriend who monitors everything I do, checks my followers, gets mad if I have girl friends on social media. We lost our apartment, because of troubles, and now we’re all living at my mothers. And there’s no internet out that way in the middle of no where. 

I don’t drink anymore, or never ever touched drugs in my life. But I feel like if I started I wouldn’t be so scared. My daughter is only 3 months and I think she won’t remember me. Which brings me a little joy. Because I’m a fuck up and people like me who are worthless should just die. I’m not religious, but I’d hope if I were to die, there is another side where I can actually be happy for once in my entire life. 

Maybe one day I can look myself in the mirror and be happy with what I see.

"I used to be suicidal. Now I'm happier than ever even when I lose. If you're sick of the pain, read this","I'm an average looking guy. But, I have red hair. Kinda brownish, still red. When you ask a girl what her dream guy is, they say tall dark and handsome. I'm tall, but not even remotely dark, and I'd say maybe average looking if that? I thought girls didn't like me in high school because I had red hair. I thought girls didn't like me in high school because I thought I was ugly. I was even told by my high school crush that I was ugly. I'm 26 now, and finally, after 11 years (14-25) of self loathing, I realize... it's all in my head. I was ugly, because I was unconfident. Confidence attracts people. I don't care how weird or lame you think you are, if you have confidence, people respect that. You win some, you lose some. I will get back to girls in a minute, for any dude that feels they're inferior.

I'm an average, maybe even severely below average, athlete (good arch in one foot, bad arch in the other, was slower than offensive lineman in hs football, never scored goals in hockey, never was much more than a benchwarmer, couldn't hit a baseball to save my life. I had a swing, but zero accuracy). But, when the game was on the line, I came through. Why? Because it's about **confidence.** For some weird, surreal reason, I believed in myself. I'm a procrastinator. I leave things till the last second. When the game is on the line, I came through. Why? Because I realized **it was my last chance.** Somehow something clicked in my brain. I realized I didn't need to be the most athletic. I didn't need to be the smartest. I needed to have the most heart. And I did. For years after, I doubted myself. I thought ""oh it was just dumb luck"". If it was dumb luck, why did I score 2 goals, including the game winner in my hs championship game, after scoring **ZERO in 38 hs hockey games prior?** Because, it was confidence, and a belief that good things would come. I was confident that my teammates could score, but I wasn't confident in myself. I finally got tired of the lack of confidence, and I believed in myself for just ONE GAME. I was the hero that game. Not the superstar center. Not the superstar left winger. Not anyone, but me. I finally believed in myself.

You ever feel like you have bad luck? You ever see someone who has nothing but good luck? Get jealous? Get sad? Get discouraged? Of course! This is natural. You see someone who doesn't have to try and has everything work out flawlessly for him/her. It's not so much that he/she is confident. It's that they're POSITIVE. **Have you EVER seen a lucky person who is nothing but negative? I haven't.** I thought luck was dumb shit. ""Oh it's cause you're good looking. Oh it's cause you're smart. Oh it's cause you're funny, popular, relatable"". How in the fuck do you think they became smart, funny, popular? CONFIDENCE. What's the ""outcast"" table look like in high school, college, any age? People who are bitter and don't fit in. But is it really because you're discriminated against? Somewhat? Absolutely. But if you're a positive, confident person, people respect that. Every see a kid get bullied? What's he do? **NOTHING.** Ever see a kid get bullied, and punch someone in the face? People respect him/her. Maybe the kid gets their ass kicked. People laugh. Make more fun of them. But if they don't back down on their confidence, the jokes slow down. Or, they become obvious that they're being jealous. People who stand their ground regardless of status, talent, etc, earn people's respect. If the outcast table didn't let people get them down, they wouldn't be an outcast table. I went to hs with a weird, nerdy, obnoxious kid. He refused to let people get him down and while people thought he was weird, they RESPECTED HIM. Because of his confidence and positivity. This leads me to one major thing, that I will now group together with a girl I lost, but met BECAUSE I was positive.

Positivity, self confidence, is irresistible. I acted like an insecure idiot around most girls I dated when I was younger. If you've never had a gf, or bf, you may feel like ""at least you had one"". But does anyone like losing someone? No. The difference between having someone and losing someone, vs not having anyone at all, is simply experience and confidence. Yes, it's better to have failed than to have no experience with relationships. But if you're a dude, or even a girl, you can learn a lot from me right now. I failed. 5 times now. Maybe even 6. I didn't really learn from my mistakes until the last one or two. I still made mistakes. Don't sacrifice who you are, for what you think your s/o wants you to be. If you cannot be yourself, then how can you expect them to like you for the real you? Look, some people won't like the real you. That's fine. But that's more about them not liking themselves, than them not liking you. When I'm negative, I don't get online dates. I don't meet girls in person. I don't feel good. When I'm positive? Something always appears. Always. It may not be today, tomorrow or the next day. But eventually, you find someone. From **POSITIVITY and self belief.** It never fails. Ironically, the best first dates I've had are ones where I'm not sure what I think of the girl BEFORE I meet them. Because of that, I don't care. I act like myself, I act confident, and I act positive. Why the hell would I be negative and insecure if I don't know if I'll even like her? That's the key. I get to be myself because I don't put expectations in. You may be wondering ""what happened to being positive?"". Being positive is always good. But the fact of life is not everything goes your way, however, it can be good to have no expectations, because then you feel no pressure to be yourself. It's a blend of having no expectations, and being positive. See a pattern? You either put no pressure on yourself by having no expectations, or you believe something good will happen. It's always better to believe in yourself but it's okay to not have expectations. For every night I shake and shudder in bed, comes a morning I wake up feeling depressed. For every night I go to bed thinking ""tomorrow will be a great day"", comes a day that at the least, isn't horrible. Obviously there are some circumstances with that. Maybe a family member dies on a day you're being positive. But, through it all, more good will come than bad. There have been studies about ""lucky"" people. They're all the same. They believe something good will happen, they believe behind every hardship is a happy day. Think about it. **Truly think about it.** If you are being negative, do you think you'll notice that cute person, if all you think is ""they wouldn't like me"". How are you going to chat up the person you find attractive cashing you out, or the person at the bar, if all you can think about is ""no one likes me""? You can't. 

If you are negative, you will only find scenarios where you doubt yourself. If you are positive, you will find scenarios that you take advantage of. I lost a girl that meant everything to me. Why? Because I questioned why I got to meet her. I questioned myself. I questioned if I deserved her. I questioned her AFTER things went well. I was positive and happy with her when we first met. She liked me BECAUSE I WAS POSITIVE AND HAPPY. I only drove her away when I stopped believing, in myself. Don't be the person who loses someone because they think negatively. Don't be the person who never finds someone because they feel like they deserve to be alone. I know what it feels like to be alone. Everyone has their demons. Demons' goals are never to make you happy. They're designed to ruin your life. If you've been alone forever, start doing things to believe in yourself. Start slow. I still struggle with doubt. But I used to doubt myself 23 hours a day. Then 22 hours and 59 minutes. Then 22 and 58. So on and so forth. Someday, you will believe in yourself no matter what. You will be positive no matter what. You will finally feel like life doesn't kill you. I know this feeling because I've had OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I was always negative. After some time had passed, I started reading about positivity. Confidence. LUCK. They all come when you believe in yourself. Even if no one else does. So if you feel yourself stuck at the bottom of the same well that I once was in, as recently as a few months ago, just know that their is ALWAYS a ladder to help you out.

Best metaphor I can give you, is the Wayne Gretzky one. ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"". How can you expect to score if you don't try? If you don't believe? If there's 1 second on the clock and you throw up a prayer, it will never go in if you half ass it. If you think ""this won't work so I'll just go meh, and it falls short. At least I expected it to fail"", you will never make the shot. If you try, and shoot your best shot, guess what, it can go in. Stop feeling like there's no point in trying. For every shot you miss yet believe in yourself, you start to realize ""hmmm I tried and I was pretty close"". Practice makes perfect. Nobody misses every shot they take. One will always go in eventually.",1580015462.0,0.67,2
Some progress,"A week ago, I was nearly suicidal, since my therapist told me she was going on maternity leave.

Does anyone else ever feel like God forgot about them/you must have done some seriously awful shit in a past life to deserve what you’re going through?,"To make a long story short, I went to two Top 20 schools (undergrad and law school). Landed a dream firm job right out of law school that was paying close to $200k - right off the bat, work was slow and that’s never a good thing when you’re starting out. The satellite office I worked out of pretty much imploded and I was laid off right at a year of working there. Struggled a shit ton with depression/unemployment for a few months until I finally got a new job with another huge firm - just happened to be in a completely different city. Packed up my whole life and went to live in a city I couldn’t stand just to get past the 2 years of experience mark. Turns out this firm was even worse than I expected and I got pushed out a day after they “approved” me going to see a therapist around the corner from the office for my anxiety (which is super fucking common for lawyers in BigLaw to deal with). They actually approved my ADA form - because it’s a legal requirement - only to swiftly tell me to get the fuck out. Really messed with my head even more and I debated suing them but was dissuaded by people who said I would fuck my career over by doing that. So now I find myself once again in a state of unemployment with even worse depression/anxiety. I guess my whole point is: Things have to get better eventually, right? I’ve been trying to read inspirational books and keep interviewing/applying to jobs, but man it feels like life can seriously fuck you over for more than just a “season.”",1580015227.0,1.0,0
Purpose and Happiness Comes from Other People,"I spend a great deal of my time watching shows/movies and I have to say any time there's a character that I relate to who's lonely, worthless, hopeless, and just has no aspirations or happiness they always get ""fixed"" by meeting someone. This person becomes their best friend or lover. This person completely changes them and gives them hope, happiness, and everything they were missing. This person unlocks all those things inside the character I relate to....

Im just getting tired of seeing that. I just really dont see those kind of people actually existing. If they do, they want nothing to do with me and I'll probably never find them anyway.  Just makes me think that loving yourself, discovering your own self-worth, and finding your purpose is all a myth. Makes me think I'll never get any of those things.",1580015127.0,1.0,1

Not really sure if I suffer from depression but people her me seem nice enough to share with.,"I find myself feeling as if I need to strive for perfection in all things in my life. It was really bad this past week. One mistake at work can cost me not just money but my business as a whole, possibly even someone’s life. So you know, I have to dedicated my complete and total mental capacity to doing my job. Yet I still make mistakes. Working with a customer breathing down your neck sucks, and just adds undue pressure, but it’s not really something I could help this week, a shorter than normal one, which I was looking forward to this weekend for a big event/vacay. But I was so brain fried by the end of my days I practically missed my gf’s birthday, which was a pretty upsetting thing for her. Her reasons being what they are I understand, but then I mispacked all my shit for the event, and the day of arrival there was always something that was just wrong enough to be aggravating. And today I had a tremendous anxiety attack thinking about the weight of the possibility of loosing one of my parents and how that would affect the other and myself and my life style. I’d loose the ability to peruse a dream I think... I feel like I just can’t win, and I don’t know what to do about it. My next therapy session is two weeks away and I know after this weekend my schedule is gonna die down a lot and without having a lot going on I fear the stagnation that brought on my anxieties I’ve been battling in the first place... maybe I just needed to vent, maybe I need to move my therapy session up a week, I just don’t know where the answers could possibly lie.",1580014585.0,1.0,3
Visited my Grandparents Today.,"Grandfather is suffering from kidney failure, he’s 92. WW2 Navy Vet, tough as nails. Today, he was not. He labored for breath and has had a very difficult time dealing with his Alzheimer’s. He could barely drink water. Although he’s very close towards the end of his life, he’s lived a very full one. Not to sound like one of those cliches, but those moments make you really question our own mortality, how your life is on a timeline. I feel a sense of shame and guilt to be so focused on my depression and sadness with all of the baggage that comes with it. It’s apart of my life now, it will be until the day I die. That’s just the short of it. I c o u l d, or at the very least, be motivated to make the best of the time I have left. I truly believe, myself included, that a good and fulfilling life awaits if this obstacle of depression and a sad disposition and perspective could be overcome. The question that remains is how. Death is apart of life they say. Thats why it’s important to appreciate the latter rather than the former. I hope this has helped someone. Godspeed y’all.",1580014283.0,0.81,0
lonliness is making me depressed again,"hi 17f i used to be depressed when i was in high school, people made rumors about me for no reason starting freshman year and all my so called “friends” had left me when i was depressed and i began abusing weed to feel better, they dropped me by claiming i stole their money i was a bad friend etc but thats another story.. it just got worse to the point where i stopped going to school and after i stopped going to school it felt really good, i was happy glad i didnt have to see those people and i didnt care if i was alone. i told myself i liked being alone. then a year goes by and here i am anxiety attacks during work, nonstop thinking about everything bad that has or hasnt happened. sadness i cant stop crying i feel alone and when i want to talk to someone i feel a pain in my chest because i have no one to talk to. mom says its my phone and i dont want to bother my dad because the thought of me stressing him out means he will get white hairs faster and that scares me. my older sister gets mad when i wanna talk to her because shes playing VR chat and my younger sister is too young to understand a thing thats happening. i’m scared to get a therapist because when i went during highschool he laughed because i said i was depressed. im going crazy im getting mad at people for no reason then i cry and apologize like a freak. i cant control my emotions i want to live so bad but i just want to disappear and i want to see what happens in the future but i dont because my parents will be old and i dont like to think about that stuff but my brain forces me to think about it. ive also had this ringing in my ear that wont stop so that is also making me go crazy faster. here i am sharing my mess of a self to reddit hoping i can get some sort of feeling like i spoke to a friend about my problems. i dont know what to do anymore. i thought if i did good things would go my way but thats not how life works and no matter good or bad i always feel like the shit comes back. sorry for the long post. its kind of nice to let this feeling out though, but i still made myself cry writing this.",1580014257.0,1.0,12

No online help/resources for men,"This is sort of a drunken rant fueled by beer and a mix of depression/hatred. English isnt my first languae so forgive if i write something that isnt 100% coherent.

The point is that there es pretty much none resources for men and depression, pretty much everything is just aimed for women and whatever little info i can find that is aimed towfds men is just to understanding women with depression. 

I cant find any sites that have useful info tjat i can relate or use since i am not a woman, and just being told that im annoying to women with depression is just frustriating after the first couple articles.

Every time i log into any other social media i see a lot of posts saying that male depression is important too and is a aerious concern but when im feeling the worst and try to search a solution or how to deal with something is just isnt there anything that helps. 

The only resources i have found directed towards men just have the most basic cookie-cutter answers to problems too, stuff that we have heard like a miillion times before (make excercise, eat healthu, etc). It seems they target more the occassional feelins down rather than actual depression.


Also, this is more of a sidenlte than part of the rant, but why is my sexuality as a straight male seen with such disgust? I, just like a normal person, want to be loved and love someone. Everytime i read this articles trying to sort something of my own i see the talk in those forums/Pagés/blogs talkimg about it like its disgusting amd ebarassing, annoying or like its a chore ratjer tham a display of affection thats mutual and tgat sort of thing. This has just Made me more insecure about what i want or if it is right wantimg certin stuff for fear of being seen as someone creepy or disgusting that apparently only thinks about sex.

Sorry if i have amguered or offended someone with my post, just wanted to take some stuff off my chest. This is my first post here (anon account since my family uses reddig too). If this doesnt goes here please tell me and i will delete.",1580014044.0,1.0,0
I feel pathetic because of the one thing I'm currently living for.,"Things haven't been good lately. I'm burnt out, I'm tired and anxious constantly, I'm moody and distant with the people I care about. Truth is I don't really want to be around any more, and I haven't for a while. 

I've done a pretty good job of finding things to live for. A new plushie at Build a Bear, conventions, fun nights with friends, I've been able to add things to my future schedule to keep myself looking forward. 

Right now, it's Animal Crossing for the Switch. I filed my taxes in record time and I'll be buying a switch just so I can play. I remember being a kid and Wild World being my savior on many a bad day. I lost hours fishing and catching bugs and building relationships with my favorite villagers, and I'm ready to do it again. 

But part of my brain keeps laughing at me and telling me I'm pathetic, that I'm too tired to enjoy the game again, that it's ridiculous that a 24y/o needs the security blanket of a favorite video game to not kill themselves. I'm terrified I'm going to ruin it for myself. I'm actually looking forward to this, I'm not staring at it with the same dull eyed apathy I give most things these days. What if I'm just wearing rose tinted glasses, and the reality is I'm just a miserable adult trying to find comfort in childish things?

Disregarding that, shouldn't I just be able to live for myself? I don't know if I can drag through another forty years of trying to find one thing or the next to keep me interested in living. I'm already so tired of doing that.

No matter what I do everything is the same,"No matter what I do in life I always end up with the same results. Depressed and lonely.

I have such an amazing and understanding family and I have the best friends a guy could ask for. I eat healthy, work out a lot and I am pretty good looking (not trying to be cocky). I had an incredible childhood and I excelled in sports and school. I have pretty much everything I could ever ask for. The problem is when I was 18 or 19 I got very depressed after a tough break up. I became extremely self destructive and tried to drink away all of my problems. I was drinking every single day of my life for years and everything just kept getting worse and worse. Through it all I somehow managed to stay a functioning member of society as far as working and paying my bills went but school took a backseat for a couple years. The last couple years I was able to slowly start trying at life again. I'm almost done with my second year of college and I'm 6 months sober (except for weed a couple times a week). I was able to get closure on my past relationship and really move on. No matter what I do the feelings that it caused just continue to stick with me.

I really don't know what my next step is in trying to fix myself because it feels like I have tried everything. I want to put myself out there and meet an amazing girl that loves me but I don't want to use a relationship as a means to bring myself happiness. I desperately want to fix myself before latching onto someone else for the rest of my life. At this point I can't even really imagine what my future might be like.

"First Time On This Sub. Looking For Advice And Just Venting, I Guess","As I said, this is my first time on the sub. I'm 15 and going to high school right now. I haven't been officially diagnosed, or I don't know, but my therapist says I have depression and I'm on 20 mg of fluoxetine right now, which I'm kind of skeptical about. My parents are pretty supportive about it, but I'm not very honest about my mental health with them to be honest. I don't think they even know I'm depressed they just think I have social anxiety, which I probably do. 

I guess what I'm kind of looking for advice on is this: I'm very socially awkward, and I have friends who I can be very talkative with, but it takes me like upwards of three months to warm up to anyone. I find it incredibly hard to talk to people, or will myself to do anything. I spend my time at home watching the same episodes of *The Office* over and over again, and masturbating. I have no motivation. When I have to do work I just sit there and watch youtube, or something and play some pointless game in the background because the youtube isn't enough of a distraction. I want to care, I really do.

What really bothers me is I have no idea what the fuck to do. I don't know how to change, or will myself to do anything. If I tell myself to talk to a girl, and fire myself up to do it I just don't do it. It's the same with the homework thing. I just don't do anything that I don't have to do. I know I shouldn't worry about relationships, being only about to turn 16, but I feel like I'll never be in a relationship. I've literally never been friends with a girl, not because I don't want to. I'm scared I won't be able to function as an adult. I'm scared I'm never going to get a job, or even be able to make it through college the way things are going now. I try to get absorbed in hobbies, like I'm trying to learn the guitar right now, but sooner, or later I know I'm just going to lose my motivation.

I know I have it a lot better than so many other people, but I just kind of wanted to vent I guess. I don't really have anyone to talk to. My friends only invite me to do stuff every once in a while because they feel bad for me I think and I think they're embarrassed being seen around me. I just feel really alone. I haven't cried in like a year, or had a good day for as long as I can remember. I feel like a fucking creep. I do weird shit like not brushing my teeth for a week.

10 months ago, I went into a tailspin after being dumped. I kind of isolated myself and really let myself go.

I started socializing a little more, getting back into my hobbies, eating well, and exercising. I even lost 15 lbs since the start of 2020! 

Then tonight, a guy compared my looks (negatively) to another girl’s in a room full of people. I was humiliated. I should mention that I’m also very socially anxious. I was at a party with a friend; I usually avoid parties/large crowds but I was trying to step out of my comfort zone.

I started missing my ex bc he used to make everything feel ok and like I could get through anything. However, he can’t do that anymore, all he does is hurt me and makes me feel the opposite of ok.  But i started to patch things up with my friend and apologize even though he was the one in the wrong and the one who was bitter and petty, but I rather keep the friendship than lose him over one fight, so for once I stopped being stubborn. I don’t think we can ever be close again, but it is better than fighting and ik deep down i shouldn’t have him as a close friend anyway bc he isn’t trustworthy, 
Not loyal and stabs people in the back sometimes. I think something good came out of this thought, i stopped being so angry towards my ex, while it was already fading, i feel like I actually 100% forgive him now. Hopefully, i can hang on to feeling like I don’t need him with out that anger tho. But now that that is squared away i can begin to work and focus on  myself. Like today, i ate so much: 
Chicken nuggets, fries, 2 cookies, and string cheese. It may only be one meal and 2 snacks but that is progress so i’m proud.

Feeling Vulnerable,"This is probably a brief moment until my anger and hatred will come back.

As if now, i just feel soo vulnerable and weak. I feel forgotten, ousted, left behind.

At times like i can see myself from a third person perspective and see the inner workings of society all around me. why people are together. why they hang out. why they are so close.

But for this one girl, i don’t understand why is she is left alone. behind. or worse hated? Sure she hold grudges like a death grip only because she doesn’t want to enter a cycle of an abusive relationship where it’s always making the other person happy.

She makes people laugh, she tries her best, she offers her hand to those that need her. To some she’s called a sweetheart, someone they can look up to.

Yet no one wants to be with her or even wants to know who she is. People say “ oh she doesn’t reach out”, but don’t you have to reach for her because you have to have the desire to want to know.

Her best friend is herself. When she’s sad, depressed, crazy, vengeful the only person she could really talk to is herself.

Why do people hate her? She doesn’t go after people. She doesn’t plan nefarious plans to give people a hard time. She doesn’t insult people and when she does she apologizes and makes things right.

What do you guys think that makes her so hated by everyone around her? Is she delusional? A liar? A demanding snob? Sadly this is all she has to work with no one wants to talk to her.

So far the only thing i came up with is “ just because people enjoy your company doesn’t mean they want you around” Ever since then i been living that code.

Never had a choice, but understands i need to fight in order to survive

Sexually Asulted and No One Belived Me,"I didn't really know where to post this but I've been struggling with depression even before I was assaulted because of my father's drinking problem and all the issues that brought to my family. We had to move out of our home because he didn't work but would spend money like he was earning 150,000+ a year. This started when I was young but it was managable until last year when O was sexually assaulted (forced to penetrate, as it wasn't legally rape because I am a man) and then accused of rape by the person who raped me. As a man no one belived me so after I told a few people the full story and got backlash I just said I was falsley accused when they asked. When I told my dad I wanted to do something legally against the rapist (I told him several times but he didn't want to as he didn't believe me either) it came to a point that he told me he wouldn't care if I when to jail for life if it meant ""me shutting the fuck up"". My ""friends"" kept hanging out with the woman who was spreading lies after I repeatedly told them not to. They treated it as any other highschool drama, ""we don't want to pick sides"". I've been having legal battles ever since to prove my innocence but it doesn't have an end anywhere in sight. After a year and a half and now entering my second semester of university I decided to just leave all the group chats I had with my so called friends. It took me a while because I was scared of what would happen, being completely alone as I am now. I feel like shit and being alone with my thoughts makes it worse minute by minute. I've sought therapy but living in a conservative country like Mexico every therapist I've gone too has said the same thing. ""That can't happen to a man"" or something along those lines. I really don't know what to do as I go to a local university like most of my ""friends"" and the rumor has spread there too and I have had no luck making any kind of friend ship (even superficial) in my first semester of uni. Now I barley leave my room as I have no reason to leave. I've lost all passion for everything I used to like, studying, music, instruments, nothing bring me joy anymore not even the things I could rely on when I first started having depression.",1580011386.0,1.0,3
I finally actually filled out the form to get help,So as the title says I have actually got around to applying to have an appointment to see if it helps at all with sorting out my head a little bit. I don't know how much it will help or even if it will at all. To be honest I don't really even know what to expect but its gotten to the point now where I barely feed myself and only do that just so my family and friends don't just find me dead one day. To those of you who have had appointments in the past what kind of thing should I expect. Is it literally just a case of I go in there and tell them what I think is bothering me or is it them questioning me? I don't really mind either way but just would like to know what to prepare myself for as if I just suddenly get bombarded without being ready it might just end up stressing me out more but also if I am not prepared to talk a load I might just end up being silent the whole time.

I think she’s (19F) now free.,"Thought about this for a while, I was skeptical about posting it first but for the first time in a very long while I just want to speak and let some words out.
My girlfriend of three years broke up with me a few days ago, she said it’s best if we go our separate ways. 
I met her on one of these social media apps and someway somehow we started communicating a lot, normal conversation start became late night texts and.. you know how the story goes.
Honestly when I realized I was having feelings for I tried to get away and this is due to my pessimistic perspective way of seeing life.

I lost my mum when I was very young and my dad just a few years after. I don’t have to dictate what happened afterwards. Conventionally life becomes shztty. I had a rough childhood, physical and mental abuse was constant through it. I still carry scars on my body. 
I attempted suicide when I was 15,  someway somehow I survived the accident and afterwards I figured there are a lot of lives that I’ve touched at such a young age. The only thing that makes me happy is helping others, helping orphans get clothes with the little money I worked for or helping patients in need of financial help. 
“I’ll never attain happiness, not in this life.
People like me aren’t meant to be happy but I’m at peace knowing others might yet find happiness through me.” I told myself this till my mind, soul and body accepted it. A reason to live.

She’s this lively person and to put her personality in words I’ll say “electrifying”
She isn’t a calm before the storm, she’s the calm in the midst of the storm.
When I figured I was starting to have feelings for her I planned my death to just disappear before anyone gets hurt. I made a promise to myself to never let my heart get attached to someone. 
Lost my mum and my dad was the only hope I had left then he got sick too and I lost him. My sister was there for me to make sure I don’t see myself as an orphan. She tried her best from clothing to education. When I felt a little bit of hope, life took her from me. 
My very first girlfriend cheated on me with someone from her school.
Perhaps this might give you an idea of how shredded my emotions are.

Someway somehow my ex and I started a relationship, it was good. She was so kind and full of life, we had a lot of dreams. If only life is fair huh. As time passed I became dependent on her, I gave her way too much part of me that I’m starting to believe there could be a chance to be happy in this life, that she’s the one for me and honestly that’s bad because I don’t think I can afford the heartbreak. It’s pessimistic, I know.
I had some girls have dirty conversations with me on my socials and I gave her my details so she can see it and say I wasn’t faithful, at least that’ll make her break up with me. I didn’t want to be dependent on her. I prefer the cold side of life, it’s all I know. I didn’t want to take any chances.

It happened and she was rightly mad just as planned, I waited for the break up but it never came. She wanted us to work it out. 
I just came out clean to her that I just wanted to break up but she asked me to stay and I just let my feelings think for me. We were very much in love. Weeks after she told me about this incident of a guy kissing her during the whole time I was trying to break up with her. It hurt and it was like the pessimistic future was certain. I thought of it for a while and I told her it’s fine, we can work through it.

The few months were thee best I’ve come close ever since my parents, it’s like a new hope for life even though she doesn’t think I trust her enough and I wasn’t open to her as she was to me. Little arguments here and there but we worked through them. 
One of the stand out problems from my side is I don’t call often and that is due to the fact that I honestly do not like phone calls because of a phone call I couldn’t make.
Last time I spoke with my sister we had a verbal fight that I hate myself for till this minute. She wanted me to be patient with life and stop hanging out with some people because I was hacking people’s account, especially married men having affairs. I threatened to expose them to their family and I get paid in mobile credit to keep shut. 
She got sick few weeks later, the hospital was far and I didn’t have the means to make a single phone call to speak with her. The next news of her that came to me was her death, it shattered me. I couldn’t tell her she was right and I love her and she’s everything to me. I hated phone calls afterwards.

I know I kept switching between my past and my relationship but I think my past has almost everything to do with my present.

Our relationship was good, she celebrated her birthday few weeks ago. Here’s an excerpt from what I sent her. 
“The world is too noisy, life lost purpose and every picture is just blurry and when I try hard to see it from a different perspective.. it just is bleak. When my ship wrecked in the middle of an ocean and the only thing in sight was the storm about to mix with the huge tidal waves that’ll have me drowned you came on, you’re the hope that redefined life for me cos even amidst that storm you showed me the ocean can yet to sailed.”

It was a rocky relationship, we have our moments but it could’ve been better.
Major depression, trauma, anxiety and adhd were what I’m struggling with and sometimes I feel like she just doesn’t understand what it’s like to be me. 
I was tired of the little fights so I opened up to her about my condition and everything regarding my parents and I went back to therapy. She was very supportive. 
Among other issues I told my therapist I want to trust me girlfriend and I want her to know that I love her and trust her, I feel like she doesn’t believe I do. It was like everything is beginning to work till I asked for her password to change her display picture then I saw some messages she shared with someone and I wasn’t comfortable with it. She was too friendly, calling him names and all that. We had a fight regarding it and said hurtful things to each other.
It’s like the numerous ones we’ve had where we get back within hours cause we promised not to go to sleep being mad at each other but she later told me she needed space and I objected and later on agree. I woke up to her text saying it’s best if we go our separate ways and I shouldn’t try to convince her because her mind is made up.

She must’ve thought about it I guess, what hurts is knowing that decision wasn’t made overnight. She must’ve been thinking about it for a while. How long has she been thinking about it? Was I hurting her all that while? 
It was difficult and the only choice there is to give what she wants. I realized I might have been holding her back, I mean come on.
I’m an emotional wreck, depressed, anxiety, adhd, still in college and I’m honestly not the best in this love thing. I have my flaws. She’s now free.

She’s the best thing to happen to me, she gave me a new perspective towards life. Hope.
I had to learn to love her just to watch her go, 
I hope she finds the happiness she’s looking for wherever she may find herself.

Hate being so worthless,"I'm so lazy, can't do anything right, I'm not good at anything productive, and I'm just a burden that's scared of everything and the only friend I have is my GF at this point. 

If I wasn't so scared to die, I would kill myself. I've been having some rare seizures occurring the past couple of years. I keep thinking that I would just Black out and never wake up again. I'm trying really hard not to do that to not jynx anything and I know my GF would be devastated so I'm only tethered to live essentially. I really wish I could do music (writing lyrics and performing) for a living which is the only thing I'm good at but the chances of that are slim so why even bother trying.

I hate being poor too on top of it all. Not because it's stressful but because I've always wanted to help my poor parents out but since I can't even graduate college on time, I feel like I've screwed everything up.

Worst part of it all is that it just sounds like I'm some whiny b*t h. There's someone with a way worse life than I'm living and I'm just on my phone complaining but I just can't help it.

I feel so trapped lol,"I just need to vent and talk to anyone. I realized this last year that I’ve been depressed since I was 13 and I’m 19 now.

How can I help a depressive person who tends to isolate themself?,"Hello, I've been dating this guy for about a month and a few hours ago he told me about how his depression seems to be coming back again and I want to know how I can be helpful to him.

&#x200B;

Just to establish some context, he seemed very happy on our first dates and we used to text everyday, send pictures, etc. We were really going somewhere, we both said we liked eachother and, suddenly, he stops reaching me. At first, I though he just decided he wasn't interested on me anymore and I was about to just let go but when I confronted him about it, he said he's been on a bad psychological state and his depression was starting to get at him again, and something that helped him cope with it was isolation, in his own words, it brought him comfort and fear at the same time. I tried speaking to him a few times after but he always seemed distant and our conversations were really short but I kept trying to keep a constant contact, even if not daily.

I just don't know how to keep going, we can't really connect when he's like this and he doesn't seem to want to go out. He told me he doesn't want me to disappear because he likes me back, but it is hard when we can't really have a full conversation.

I hate January.,"January is an odd month. For most it’s centered around New Years resolutions, setting goals, and becoming more ‘zen’. I see January as more of a black hole, one that sends me spiraling back into a time warp. Relieving the days leading up to my mother’s death every year in complete and accurate order. It starts with a car ride. A rather hazy day in my memory, but a day ingrained nonetheless. “Things will change when we get home.” It wasn’t a threat, more of a somber statement from an exhausted woman. I asked a lot of questions on that ride home, as any curious child would. I was shushed and told to leave it be. “You know I want a divorce.” Again, not a threat. However, this statement spit more coming from an angry, albeit exhausted, man. Time to pray. I sought solace in our family room, huddled on the sofa only feet away from hushed tones and stifled tears. I did what all children do, I prayed that God would intervene. I wasn’t ready to see my family fall apart. I needed things to work out for my own selfish desire. “I think my parents are splitting up.” It fell out of my mouth like a tasteless bile. I hadn’t intended on ruining my best friends birthday, but I also hadn’t intended on going. I was attempting to grasp any shred of normalcy as what seemed to be a perfect life fell in around me. “I think we should break up.” This would begin my cycle of disassociation and distrust. I didn’t want to hurt him, but I had no intentions of prolonging the inevitable. He spat at me with his ugly tongue about how selfish I was, how insensitive I was to not allow him to ‘be there for me.’ This began my cycle of reclusion. I retreated to my room night after night and pressed my ear to the floor. I wanted to stop listening to the sounds of your angry voices, the stifled sobs. I wanted to make it go away, to run to you both and make you listen to me. I stayed still on the floor listening quietly until I succumbed to sleep. This would begin my cycle of insomnia. “Your sister will be there to pick you up.” A choked sound of a woman vomiting. A dead dial tone. I am home, it’s late and the house is quiet. My thoughts are deafening. The phone rings. My father turns off the television with defeated huff. “Your mother is in the hospital. She loves you. She’ll see you tomorrow.” Perhaps this was a threat. I went to school the next day, with no focus. I was completely dazed. Again, I prayed. I plead. I bartered.  I saw you, but you weren’t there. Sometime in the night your brain fired its last signal. A machine has replaced your ability to breath on your own. A machine has replaced the ability for your heart to continue to beat. I thought perhaps I would scream, instead what I felt was my brain firing one last signal. A last signal of love, of hope. I suppose January can be representative of new growth, it grew cold around my heart. It grew an anger with which I have yet to control. It grew a resentment of self. It grew a child that’ll never quite feel whole.",1580010269.0,1.0,0

I'm terrified of contacting the suicide hotline.,"As of recently, I've been delving deeply into religion and its unique views of what happens to people who commit suicide. Of course, it's all negative results. But is it set in stone? Suicide = eternal suffering in hell? Suffering in life, and after death too? Why?!

I feel like I'm very close to killing myself, and I'm trying so hard to find answers that clearly don't exist. I keep a box of shotgun slugs underneath my bed, right next to the compact shotgun I bought a couple months ago. I often ""practice"" my positioning and dry-firing so I can override the instinctual fear flinch. 

 I've considered contacting the hotline or chat site several times, but I'm very afraid of saying too much and having them send the police to my house to involuntarily admit me to the hospital. I can't afford to be away from my job for an unknown amount of time. 

I live paycheck to paycheck, being the sole breadwinner for my family because my (healthy, able-bodied) mom refuses to get a job after being fired over a year ago. I can't afford to see a therapist or get antidepressants. My job doesn't offer sick days, and I haven't been there long enough to use one of my 5 vacation days. There's no one who could help me.

I talked to my grandmother about how I've been feeling today, and she basically said I feel this way because I don't have enough faith in God to basically make me smile through my daily suffering. I do have faith; I'm trying so hard to avoid pulling the trigger. I'm trying to avoid writing suicide notes to her, my mom and my boyfriend.

I’ve been wearing the same clothes for 3 days.,"I’ve been wearing the same clothes for three days, haven’t showered, haven’t brushed my teeth, and have been sleeping a lot.

This past Tuesday, I quit my job. I’d previously put in my notice and was supposed to work until Friday. Depression and anxiety overwhelmed me so I left around 1:00 pm. I am able to quit my job because my boyfriend makes enough money to support us both. I texted him about how sick I was feeling and he gave his consent to go ahead and leave work for good. 

Since then, I’ve been laying around the house and sleeping. I haven’t showered. I haven’t brushed my teeth. I haven’t taken out the trash. I haven’t done dishes. I haven’t cleaned up after myself much at all. If my boyfriend were home, I would not be acting this way. He’s gone for work all but 3 months per year. Right now, I’m glad he isn’t home to see me like this. 

Depression has a hold on me. I have nightmares about my mother holding me hostage and I can’t get away from her; 3-4 times a week. I have nightmares about my grandparents still being alive and remembering that they aren’t while still asleep. I loved them so very much and still grieve over their deaths. I have nightmares about my father and being in his filthy home without any food. 

My boyfriend had a cancerous tumor removed from his lungs in November. He stayed home until the first of January. I noticed my depression getting worse around Christmas. I feel horribly lonely around the holidays. My family is so toxic that I haven’t been able to have a relationship with them in years. Even though my boyfriend was here being as supportive as he could be, I still cried on Christmas. I was supposed to be taking care of him, not the other way around. 

I’m not sure if my depression started because of my boyfriend’s life threatening tumor or my loneliness during the holidays. My nightmares have been constant for a years it seems. I’m unsure of what in my life has such a hold on me that I can’t be around people anymore. The only comfort I feel is being home. 

When I started a new job in September, I’d been home for two months. I was fired from my job of five years due to a work “friend” that told my boss that she was “afraid for her safety” when she and I got into a text argument about her being selfish. She told our mutual friend that she never meant for me to get fired, only reprimanded. None of our fight had to do with work. I was absolutely devastated and still cry over being fired to this day, more so over who I thought was my friend completely betraying me. I never even got the chance to defend myself when told that I needed to leave. 

Being at home for two months was therapeutic in a sense but also very depressing. I lost my purpose. I didn’t feel like myself anymore. I didn’t want to be the stay at home girlfriend living off her boyfriend for no particular reason. I’m wanted to get back out and work so that I could build our lives together as a team, not me reaping the benefits of his labor. I also didn’t have medical insurance or any type of savings/retirement. 

At the new job, everything seemed fine at first. Both ladies that I worked with in close proximity seemed cool. When I agreed to make my employment there permanent (I was working on a temporary basis), everything seemed to change. I found that my coworkers were whispering about me and ignoring me. It triggered a lot of emotions that I hadn’t felt in a long time, mostly rejection. 

I suffer from an illness that is most of the time tolerable. It’s called Misophonia. Many people think that I’m lying about it or that I’m just being a diva when I say that things they do trigger it. I was triggered every day by one of my coworkers. Despite my best attempt at talking to her about it, she was offended and seemed to do things out of spite. I spoke with my boss about it too and he gave me the same look everyone else does - he didn’t believe me. He also said that he didn’t have a solution for me. I gave my notice that day. 

Here I am laying on the couch writing to Reddit, smelling horrible and I don’t care. I know that I need to get up and make myself useful but just feel so incredibly lethargic. This makes me feel useless, thus added to my depression. I’ve always been very active and independent. Right now, I feel like a loser. 

Above all, I feel ridiculous that I’m even upset. I live in a wonderful home with a very understanding, supportive man. I have food to eat. I have a bed to sleep in. I have three incredible little kitties that I adore. Why can’t I snap out of it? Why can’t I just enjoy how lucky I am to be in the position that I am? Will my boyfriend start to resent me? Will I lose him? 

My therapist was kind enough to offer me a cash discount to come in for $50 per visit. I have an appointment Monday. I hope that together we can figure out what I need to do to get better. I feel like my meds aren’t working anymore but I don’t want to up my dosage. My withdrawals are gnarly. I have Klonopin for anxiety attacks, Ambien for sleep, and Effexor for depression. The amount of pills I take to function hurts my pride. 

BTW, I had an anxiety attack when I got to my car Tuesday. I completely broke down crying, had trouble breathing, my lips were numb, and I felt like I was going to throw up. I FaceTimed my boyfriend to show him proof that I was not faking anything I told him I was going through. He talked me down off the ledge and I was able to drive home. I slept the rest of the day.

TL; DR: Depression and social anxiety has held me hostage in my own home. I’m going to see a therapist to figure out how to cope with issues I’ve been struggling with and to heal from my past. My boyfriend is able to support us both but my pride is broken.",1580009670.0,1.0,2
I feel like this is the point in my life where things change.,Nothing will be the same. My ambitions are dying. I don't even know if I want to be happy.

"So sick of this!!! Happy for a little bit then feeling so down that you don't want to be around. It will never end, I feel so trapped.","I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 4 years ago, even though it was affecting me long before the diagnoses. What happened was I had a serious trauma happen right after recovering from 2 concussions. The concussions happened a month apart, but 2 months after the 2nd concussion huge trauma. Threw me into a depression deeper than I had ever had ever before and I had dealt with it in the past but just assumed that life was depression with minor bits of happiness in between.

So this depression drives me so far that I almost died a couple times but didn't. I was so ok with me dying that it was normal to plan it. My family has always just gotten angry with me for being depressed, because it's affecting them, so they shit all over me because that's apparently the answer. And they wonder why I don't talk to them. There's been to many things that have happened to me to get into but in my mind they were all just parts of life. Until I found out it wasn't. So I go see a psychiatrist and Bam clinical depression, textbook she said. Same with the second Psychiatrist. In the past when I would get tested for Bipolar disorder I wouldn't be honest enough to get a true result but when I was it was clear. 

So I get on anti-depressants and Lithium and was taking them regularly and properly for so long and things were better even though I felt neutral always. Then started having problems with taking the lithium, side effects.... So I'd put them aside and forget to take them. I also don't eat really, I'm as poor as they come. But I don't eat because there's no point. Now I'm all over the place with my meds. I'm up and down with my moods, 90% of the time its down. I know my life isn't going to get better as this disorder only gets progressively worse. I feel like I'd be do more harm then good. I have no friends other then my 2 brothers, and I even seriously doubt that one.

It would be less of a drain on society. I did have dreams but they are so long gone along with any hope I did have. I just feel beaten and I'm tired, so tired. Like bringing myself to write this post took 3 days. I'm not expecting anything really, I just thought maybe somebody knows something.

I’m 28 and feel really hopeless about my future...,"I’m experiencing panic attacks for the first time in my life.

Things seemed fine until I realized I didn’t know what I was doing and I quit after two months because it stressed me out too much. 

It’s been a couple months since I left and I haven’t been able to find another job and honestly I’m scared to get another job in the field because I feel incompetent. I’ve looked into alternative careers but my degree is very specific and a lot of the other jobs require experience in the field. I want to leave the field but I spent so much time and money on it and have no other job experience. My family also has high expectations.

I’m not sure what to do because I still live at home, have student loans to pay and want kids before it’s too late (I’m a female). I think the only good things right now are that I have an emotionally supportive partner and an education (although I’m not sure how well it’ll serve me if I leave the field). I do have “passions” outside the healthcare field, that are related to art but I don’t think I can make a living off these.

I feel Broken,"I’ve been struggling with depressive thoughts for about two years now, and recently things have taken a turn for the worse.

To summarise, my current university course is one I got forced into by my parents, kick-starting a lot of resentment and lack of motivation to excel in it. After spiralling further and attempting to take my own life in April last year, I decided that I would take this year off in an attempt to figure things out with my mental state.

Needless to say my parents weren’t particularly happy with my decision, turning on all the emotional manipulation and gaslighting tools they had, telling me that I didn’t have a choice other than to continue and that my depression was just a phase I’d get through. Things escalated and my girlfriend of 2.5 years broke up with me last week as she felt she couldn’t take the additional burden of having me in her life along with her work and studies.

My other friends have been wonderfully supportive, but I’m afraid that they’ll crack under the stress like my girlfriend did, and it gets more difficult to talk to people about my thoughts every time. My emotions aren’t really all there anymore, it’s been very numb for quite a while and I feel disconnected from my life, like I’m just along for the ride while someone else controls my body

I’ve organised appointments with a psychologist and psychiatrist but at this point I’m not sure if it’ll help any, or even if I want to change my mindset. I feel broken in that even though I can objectively recognise myself as being in a bad mental state, I don’t want to fix it at all.

I'm scared, I fucked myself over so hard and I don't know what to do.

i'm manic and bipolar and diagnosed with severe depression, and take meds for it and certain things really set me off and I don't know what to do, I feel like there's no other options, i've done everything I can. I can't find help anywhere.

[40M] Finally have a diagnosis: Preoccupied Anxious Attachment Disorder.,"I'm kind of a mess right now. By kind of, I mean big. I got this diagnosis after a year of regular therapy (I've been in therapy for 2 years, this is my 2nd therapist). 

I'm told that it's not typical for a grown adult to have an attachment disorder. But there it is. In my case, PAAD means, in simple terms, I form attachments very easily, and put a high emotional investment into attachments, but just as easily as they're formed, they can be lost.  While the attachment (perceived or real, by the way) exists (is ""activated""), I go through bouts of euphoria, mania, high anxiety, dwelling -- even obsessing -- on the attachment, what it means to me, how important it is, how it will play out in some fantasy or extrapolated future, and ultimately how utterly terrible and painful it would be to lose it.  

Typically these are -- at least in my head -- romantic relationships. An overly simplified label would be an infatuation or a crush, but platonic relationships apply as well.  Eventually (this can be over just a few days and it could be that I barely know the person) what's going on in my head starts spilling out into my behavior, my words, my attitudes, and the person is pushed away.  At some point, whether through my own actions or just the person going about their normal life and moving out of my life, the attachment is ""deactivated"".  That's when my world crumbles and I sink into the depths of extreme negativity in the form of anger, self-loathing, and extreme depression.

One silver lining to this condition is that -- if I could manage to control my emotions and how I exhibit them -- were I to be in a romantic relationship I would be very loyal, and a good provider of emotional support, nurturing, and affection; and would be happy to receive them as well. A relationship would be very fulfilling for me and my partner.  One could say that that's not the condition at all and is simply me as a person.  However, self-sabotage -- my bastard of a defense mechanism -- prevents me from even being social, let alone ask someone on a date, let alone interact with a potential romantic partner.  Women naturally will judge my behavior and not have much interest because I simply cannot act ""normally"" and not raise red flags.  At a minimum, I've been described as stand-offish, disinterested, unable to establish chemistry, overly platonic, and lacking sexual or social confidence; in the worst case, I've been described as creepy, clingy, and unstable (those worse descriptions only happened one time but it was pretty devastating).

I've noticed lately that the depression isn't subsiding. The most recent case of activation/deactivation is my new (soon to be former) roommate. She's a much younger woman, who's very friendly, outgoing, and really goes out of her way to interact with me socially.  Naturally, I fell in love with her almost immediately (I realize people would disagree about it being real love, but that's subjective I guess).  It had been getting more difficult to hide my feelings, as it had been getting more difficult to tell myself that signs of her wanting space and to keep things platonic were not rejections and were not judgments on me as a person.  Unfortunately, my world fell apart when she told me yesterday that she'd be moving out in 2 days. I kept a calm, cool demeanor, acted like it was totally not a problem for me and that I understood (her reasoning was sound, but it's impossible for me to not internalize and take it personally).  Since then, I've been in a downward spiral of depression and self-hatred.

Ultimately all I want is to love and be loved. To give and feel affection, support, a connection, emotional intimacy, a loving embrace.  I do not believe that my whole life and mental state has to be fixed perfectly, and I believe that if someone wanted what I want, things would be better.  I also feel that I have no time. I feel like I'm a hundred years old. I've missed out on the best years of my life. I don't care that I could be 50 and capable of having what I want. I don't want to wait any longer.  I want my life back that was taken from me (not just my condition, but because of various traumas that destroyed me as a kid and teenager).  Every day I feel there's less and less hope. I don't believe I'm worthless and would have no value to someone, but I believe I may never be able to convince someone of my worth.  I'm so terrified of loss and yet terrified of being vulnerable, to the point that I can only continue to isolate myself until I truly will believe there are no other options but the ultimate option. I feel I have no choice, no power, no control over anything, especially when it comes to giving and receiving love, and especially romantic love. 

This internal battle I have seems never ending, and I feel like I'm losing, and I feel like the battle will end with me at the bottom of an abyss of misery, despair, and being utterly alone.",1580007530.0,1.0,0
I hate how I can be having a good day then...,"I hate how I can be having a good day and then the most trivial thing will set my depression off.

I used to travel, and now I haven’t left New England since 2013. No degree, and panic attacks at the thought of going back to school and having to write papers. All I do is eat my feelings and watch Dateline, even though my place is looking like a low-level episode of Hoarders so I should be cleaning. I am loathe to admit it, but I have gained weight, and despite Noom and WW I can’t seem to get rid of it (see eating my feelings). I am NC with my father, but he wrote me a happy birthday email, and dropped the bomb that he has advanced kidney disease, can’t get a transplant, and to warn me that I might get it too. Just another thing to add to the genetic mess that is me. The only good things in my life are my mom, who is pretty much my entire family, and my amazing kitty boys. I don’t know what I would do without them. They are my entire support network.

"I'm right at the beginning of a depression cycle, and I'm trying to write what it feels like. I'm hoping you guys could provide some feedback and maybe even help me expand on some points.","Caveat: I know not everyone experiences depression quite the same way, but if any of this rings true for you, or if you could add on a nuance, I would love to hear your input.

&#x200B;

Depression is not just boredom. It's more than that. 

It starts out very slowly, just a weird niggling, a sense of dissatisfaction. You want…something. But you don't know what it is. You keep trying to find it, searching your things, your thoughts, your memories, trying to pinpoint that one thing that would satisfy this existential itch undergirding everything you do. 

You play your games, but the games are not satisfying the itch, so you put them aside. You watch your favorite shows and movies, but you're not really watching them so much as looking for that thing that you're missing. You hold still, hoping that maybe if you're quiet and listen real hard, that the solution will become evident. You remember you need to be active, so you go out and do stuff, but there is not much effort expended there. You just know doing stuff isn't going to fix the itch. 

Eventually you come to the realization that nothing is satisfying that itch, and then everything goes from being unsatisfactory for that itch to being unsatisfactory in general. Like you'd stepped into a fog that had creeped up so stealthily you didn't see it coming, but now you're detached from everything else. What you can see is dull, gray, and kind of blurry, and it understandably doesn't bring you the joy it once did. The fog thickens and solidifies. If you move your limbs, it's like moving them underwater, and the weirdness of this feeling makes you not want to move anymore. 

And the most annoying thing is the itch is still there, only now it's become an ache in your chest that has to come out as sobbing once in a while, even though you're not particularly sad about anything. You're not particularly mad about anything either, but you feel like if you don't scream that ache will burst out of your chest and you will explode. Often times you end up doing neither. You just lay there - not relaxed, not lazy. It takes effort to be those things. You don't have the energy for effort. 

Instead of waiting to explode, you start to think, hey, maybe if I cut myself open a little, it will let some of the pressure out. You don't want to cut yourself open. It requires will. It hurts. Other people notice, and they don't understand what you were trying to accomplish. But it seems reaonsable to you that this will alleviate the ache and some of the fog will clear. The part of you that remembers from last time reminds yourself that self harm doesn't fix the ache. But there is another, more vocal part of you that is very convinced that it will work this time. Maybe last time you didn't dig in hard enough. 

On the outside, you look calm, even normal, but on the inside there is a war going on. An endless loop of the same thoughts threatens to choke out all reason, to drown you in nothing. The part that is you is still in there, and it can't really fight back on its own, but it hangs on. It holds on to the hope - a hope you don't feel, just one that you vaguely remember - that this will eventually end. The relentless thought cycle takes the part that is you and pushes it into an abyss. But the part that is you holds on to the edge. Its fingers are slipping. It tells you there should be hope, even when you don't think there is any. 

One day, if you're very lucky, the stormcloud of thoughts disperse, the abyss disappears, and everything is fine again. Your energy returns. You can achieve satisfaction in the things that make you happy. You can be creative and joyful and enterprising and just relax. You look back and wonder what the whole fuss was about, forgetting the itch, forgetting the ache. All is right as rain now. 

But there is a part of you that knows it will come again.",1580005405.0,0.88,2

I just need for someone to know how much I'm hurting.,"I don't know where to begin. I'm an adult married male with a child. My wife is incredible and works so hard and is so patient with me, and my son is bright and has the most wonderful heart. But I can tell how much my panic and depression weigh on them and how much it limits their lives. I deeply miss the way my wife lit up around me when we were first married. I am depressed, which means that she is not as thrilled to be around me, which depresses me. And so the circle goes. I just wish that she could be happy from being around me and it not be coming from a place of pity. I wish I could dredge up the energy to be the kind of dad to my son that he deserves. 

I'm a high school teacher and a leader in my church. I have been awarded with multiple teaching awards and tend to be the teacher that so many of the kids hang around. They're so often telling me I am their favorite teacher. I promise that I only mention that because I know how ridiculous it sounds that I feel I can never be enough for them. I feel so low and sad and all I can do is think about how much I'm letting them down because I know that my lack of energy means I am not able to teach them all that I should. I grimace when a kid compliments me because they have no clue about my failures. Similarly, in my church i feel like such a fraud as I inspire others to find hope. I don't feel like leading anymore but I also know that there isn't anyone else who is stepping up to lead. 

I just wish I could quit everything. I have been doing that some as I have pulled out of some activities. But I know what joy I had previously and I hate to do anything rash that could prohibit me from pursuing these joyous activities in the future. 

I am not sure if anyone will read this, but if you did, thank you. I am at a point where it is so hard to see any kind of light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like such a grave disappointment to my family, my friends, my students, and my God.

I feel so disgusted with myself for not trying more natural ways to help my depression.

Insanely depressed ... can go days without talking to people.,"I finished college and my social inhibition problem started to get really bad around junior year of college. I transferred schools and moved across the country (live in the US) and made no friends in school. After graduating, I moved another 500 miles away for a job.   


It's been 7 months since I moved now and I have 0 friends. I barely talk to my parents and felt like my situation is getting worse and worse. I have tried various activities -- I did some volunteer working involving political canvassing, I started refereeing a soccer because I enjoyed playing and watching it as a kid. I am at the point where I cant even hold a conversation with people anymore -- I just don't know what to say.

My job requires me to take a series of exams to obtain certifications, but I am losing motivation. I have no desire to learn. I am underperforming in work because I lack the motivation to try/think critically.

&#x200B;

I went to a doctor and got adderall, but it doesn't fix my broader problem of lost motivation. I hate my career, I hate my life, and I don't really even have a family anymore.

For a while that was the only thing keeping me up -- the fact that I might be able to start a new job. With that gone, I feel like I lost everything.

School instantly destroys my mental stability,"I struggle with mental health no matter what I'm doing but it's manageable until I have to go to school every day. I've had this problem virtually ever since I started elementary school. I'm a freshman in college now. I noticed how bad it was one Monday after a three day weekend. I was feeling great from the little break and the second my feet hit the school grounds, all my anxiety, depression, and negativity his me like a truck.

I can find little things that make life bearable but I'm not really enjoying my time on Earth, especially if you tally up the good days compared to the bad. I have a great therapist but I can't see him that often and he's about to move away. I've lost almost all my friends since high school and haven't made a single real friend since college started. I have a supportive family but I don't have enough people behind me to face going to school anymore.

When I get really scared I shut down. My emotions all turn off and I don't feel anything. I'm getting really sad again but I haven't been able to cry in almost a year (with the exception of the first week of school). It feels nice because I know my brain is protecting me from all the pain I could really be feeling but that blissful ignorance is interrupted when school starts again and everything I've been ignoring comes out all at once. The next semester is starting, and I was so resistant to going back that my brain blocked out the fact that it started today. My brain literally made me forget that school was starting so I missed the first day. I really don't want to go. I can't seem to accept the fact that I'm going to have years more of this agonizing bullshit to go through.

I think anyone who's been through school understands why it sucks, so I don't need to waste time explaining all the reasons why I hate it. I hate being constrained by school or having a tight schedule or set of rules forced on me. But at the same time I struggle with worsening anxiety and I need a hand to hold to get through life on my own. I'm definitely not ready to go to a university or live alone yet. I would probably get suicidal again. I don't want to die but if I get scared enough, I'm worried what I'll do. I'm not going to do anything drastic, but I think about it a lot. I would really like to stop existing but there's a bunch of things I still want to do with my life, I'll worry about dying after that. The problem is, in order to achieve all my goals, I need to get through school. I'm really scared that life after school is still going to suck, if not be worse. I've survived years of serious depression, but after that was over and I got to be happy for a while, another rough patch came on ridiculously quickly. And that was when I was forced to go back to school.

I feel as if I’ll be nothing, no one will ever love me. Then again what even is Love? It’s something I crave yet don’t even understand. I’m dealing with a lot tho, recently my brothers ran away, don’t worry we found them. But they have serious problems, that children shouldn’t have. I’m the oldest, I don’t even remember a child hood. But that’s ok, I just don’t want my younger siblings to have to suffer, like I did. I know this is pretty long, and trust me there’s more. But it’s too much for me to vent about at the moment. I’m just super lonely, and just needed to talk. So that’s it for tonight. If anyone wants to talk, then I’m here, and I’ll try and help as much as I can. Because I want your life to be alittle bit better than mine. So bye for now.",1580002868.0,1.0,0
What’s the point in living if I can’t contribute to society and benefit the lives of people around me,I don’t do anything. I sit in my room all day everyday and do absolutely nothing. What kind of life is that. What’s the point of a life like that? I feel useless and a waste of space. I have a girlfriend that loves me  but even she goes to school I just wait for her to get back. I have had 3 jobs in the past and lost them all because I have panic attacks and my anxiety goes through roof before every shift. I no longer feel like I can work a job.

My personal way of warding off depression.,"I have clinical depression. It doesn't go away and I've accept that  it never will. There are moments where the weight of it all begins to crush me and I think the only way out is to end my life. 

I grip my thoughts and force gratitude into my inner dialogue. I force myself to name a list of things I have gratitude for. It can be as simple as ""I am grateful for my brown hair."" Or "" I'm grateful for the way the sunlight hits my wood floors."" 

It's like it builds a path out of that ever pressing desire to just give in. It's not easy, it takes great effort for me to find those first little things to put on my list, but as I continue I find bigger and bigger things that i am so grateful for. I had to take time and read about gratitude before I practiced this in my life.

This may or may not help someone reading this, but I figured it was worth mentioning.",1580002282.0,1.0,0

To talk or not to talk,"If someone you love has a tendency to bring up negative topics of conversation, such as death, fears, regrets, anxiety, general dissatisfaction with the world and people, suicide, etc, what is the best way to help them out? Is it better to talk things out with them, let them express their negative views and try to transmit them more positive views and advice? Or is it better to try to change the topic of conversation to something more trivial, light or happy, so the time spent in conversation is shorter? Both approaches seem to have advantages and disadvantages and I have the authentic doubt about what’s best. If you don’t talk, it may seem you don’t care or you try to escape the difficult subjects. But if you do talk about it every time they bring it up, they end up submerged in negative talk and the topics become closer to them. Especially when you are very close to them and spend most of the time together. Which approach you think is more effective?",1580001101.0,0.67,0
Slipped through the cracks,"Male, 26
I've always been neurotic since I was a kid. Ky mom once told me when I was around 5 how cute it was how I swung my arms like a monkey when I walked. I was made so self-conscious by this I didnt move my arms while walking for the next (about) 20 years. It still feels awkward to me to let my arms swing naturally.

My unspoken mantra in life was always ""if it hurts, never EVER do it again.""
I embarassed myself when I spoke and consequently I refused to speak. I'd let a teacher mark me absent back in school before even saying ""here"" and if I ever did, my face would go red. 
Sometimes I legit would be surprised to hear my own voice. I was bullied constantly, especially at home and at my peak I weighed over 360 lbs (max on my sad dusty bathroom scale).
Terrible things happened to me when I was too young to understand them, fill in the blanks however you want and you wouldnt be far off. I remember at one point begging for my life in exchange for silence, definitely being younger than 10.

I want to be a real person so much. Sometimes I feel like I'm nothing at all.
I've spent years trying to work through these weaknesses that seem endless. I've made strides that even boggle my own mind. 6 years ago I couldnt look people in the eye. Now I can carry on full conversations and I surprise myself at how little my anxiety has become without medication. People I knew years ago, and people that know me now are shocked by what I've ""accomplished"". Not just with my anxiety, I've lost 200 lbs and go to the gym regularly (fuck loose skin btw). I've made myself completely independent, I have a few friends but i still cant bring myself to hang out or really talk to them because i feel like everything I've worked towards will dissipate before my eyes if i do, like a broken spell.

I'm posting here because I've hit a wall and I want to break through it. I have no one to talk to about this, and I almost never ask for help with anything, but I'm ready to be complete, I think. Whatever I seem to have accomplished to others, it's just climbing out of a deep dark hole to me. I told a friend about my daily life because she was curious and she ended up crying. Havent talked to her since. I had no idea why she cried, I told her I cant be in a relationship or really do anything whatsoever until i feel like I'm ready (she wasnt interested or anything she was lesbian, I guess she was just concerned)

Here's my thing, I'm a complete ghost. Nobody really knows me except by the face I put on.
I just dont know where to begin with being a normal person. Typing all this shit out disgusts me, and I hope the ""short"" backstory was necessary to understanding my dilemma. 

I'm chock-full of senseless insecurity that no longer applies. I want to finish breaking free and I feel that the ultimate expression of this is having sex with a woman. I'm not a virgin, I've had extremely terrible and embarrassing experiences, not the least of which was a middle aged female baby sitter when I was around 10 (I cringe hard when people say men cant be raped by women). Every experience I've ever had wasnt something i sought out. I want to seek something out myself, how could I ever consider myself independent until I do? The thought terrifies me. I ask myself, what kind of man am I? 

Every woman I grow close to, I cant follow through. Theres so much holding me back, not the least of which is the possibility of extreme embarrassment. It's been about 14 years since I've even considered having sex again, and now I'm so far behind, I feel like I'd ruin it and I'd spiral back down into the depths of hell. That may sound dramatic, but no one I've ever met has had my experiences. No one I know lives as pathetically lonely as I do. I feel like THATS the wall I'm up against and stepping through it is so unimaginable, I cant even fantasize about being with a woman. I close my eyes and think about what it would be like and... nothing. I cant see myself, I cant see the woman I'm attracted to. Theres something there when I see her in person, but when I'm alone, its like the ultimate truth is that it's never going to happen. That I cant do it and I have to die alone. I'm not an incel. Women have tried with me and I've walked away every time. I actually ENVY incels because at least they try.  Do you think it's possible for me? How do you start?

Tl;dr yeah I didnt mean for this post to be this long, sorry if it's boring and/or graphic but I really cant do any condensing without feeling like I'm leaving something important for consideration out.

I feel like I’m alive again 😊,"What is up my dudes! I have Major Depressive Disorder and had no success with Lexapro, Zoloft, or Prozac. On Monday my Doc put me on 150 mg XL Wellbutrin. I’m on day six. Last week I couldn’t get out of bed until at least 3PM. Thursday-Saturday I haven’t been asleep past 9AM. I literally couldn’t sleep more (and boy I tried lol). I also went to the gym today for the first time since September. I know it’s early but I can definitely tell this isn’t placebo. I suppose with therapy my mental health could have corrected itself at the exact same day/time but honestly there’s no way I could fake the ability to wake up earlier than 3PM. 

Also, since Wednesday, I seem to be able to practice self-compassion and forgiveness much more easily. I’m normally very harsh on myself for the simplest things. 

My therapist also told me yesterday that I seemed a lot better compared to our previous visits. I didn’t ask if she noticed it or anything. It was unprompted, which makes me believe she was being genuine.

Hey Everyone It's My Birthday And I Feel Numb,"I turned 28 (f) today and I just feel numb. My birthday is almost like a taunt reminding me that I have not accomplished anything but acquiring the ""skill"" of mental illness. I was talking to my SO and told him that I believe life is miserable and you just have to get on with it (said this in a non emotional way which scared me and him). He wasn't happy about this and kind of made me feel embarrassed (I understand where he is coming from)? I just thought about it today and realized I need to think this way to survive because I don't think I can last if I keep on feeling and trusting hope.  I just want to get through the days and hopefully die young. 

I used to be so fun and I had many dreams that I would accomplish. I wanted to motivate young kids who went through what I went through (mental/physical abuse, sexual abuse, drug addicted parents, homeless, poverty) and show them that they can do anything they want. But around 25, woooo my mental illness reared its ugly head and depression, anxiety, and PTSD became all I know. I lost myself to it and now I'm afraid I've lost hope of getting better. I dropped out of college even though I had a 3.8 GPA, I can't help but pray for an early end, and I am riddled with anxiety. My dreams are no good and I constantly have nightmares. I miss the old me because I didn't let my situation get me down and used it as motivation; it's almost like I am paying the price for my past. Sorry, I'm kind of ranting now.

my story,"when i was 9 i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, OCD, depression and panic attack disorder. i was put on medication and everything was pretty okay, i had panic attacks but that was just how it be. When i got into grade 9 is when shit started to go DOWN. It was my first year of high school so that’s already SCARY, but i also didn’t have any friends in any classes. I decided to befriend this group of boys cause they seemed pretty chill. After awhile i realized how toxic they were?? and how they would just treat me like shit. They would call me fat literally daily and just make little jabs at me like that. I was in a very dark place. Not just because of that i think it was a mix of just a low swing in my depression and those other factors. i ended up self harming. it is a low i think back at now and can’t believe it was me doing that. After awhile my parents found out i was self harming and took every knife and lighter out of my room. It’s been two years since then and i’m happy to say that i have been clean two years now.

How much support is it fair to expect of my significant other without overwhelming him?,"CW: super brief mention of self harm. 

So my bf and I are in our late 20s/early 30s and have been together a bit less than 6 months. He seems to care about me and has told me he loves me, and I'm pretty sure I love him. It's hard to tell because I've been so apathetic and depressed recently. 

Early in our relationship, I let him know that I've been dealing with depression and anxiety and have been on meds for that since I was young, and am still trying to figure out the best way to manage it, because I feel like that's something I want to be honest about in a relationship. He seemed very understanding and asked me to tell him if I was ever feeling depressed or feel like I want to hurt myself again and asked if he could do anything to support me. I've only told him how I was feeling 3 or 4 times; he'll ask how I'm doing and I'll say ""I've been feeling sad/depressed/off lately"" or something. Every time, he either doesn't respond, or responds and doesn't acknowledge what I've said. He rarely asks how I'm doing, he generally only asks after I've asked. 

I really wish he'd say something, like ask if he can give me a hug even, but there's been nothing. Literally nothing. I don't want to burden him, so I don't know how much to actually tell him and what I can ask him to do to support me. I know he's not my therapist or a suicide hotline or whatever, but I thought he since he wanted to know that telling him would mean he would respond. I've been single for years because I didn't want to put my shit on anyone else, and now I'm feeling like that was a smart idea. I feel like he doesn't care, and it's really hurting. 

I've been doing my best with therapy/visits to the psychiatrist/taking my meds but how much can I reasonably expect of him? I sometimes just need comfort, and I'm so scared of asking too much. Any advice would be super appreciated <3",1579998089.0,1.0,0

I'm feeling better but my life is still empty and it doesn't give me any genuine joy.,"I had to reevaluate my lifestyle about half a year ago and I paid more attention to eating and sleeping right. It's still not perfect but I've been feeling better physically.


I thought this was actually going to help with my depression too and I'd finally see the colors again and I'd be motivated to do the things I like...but no.


I no longer have random moments of sadness and disappointment, but it's not like I'm happy either.

Under the mask and uniforms is constant pain,"All my life I've been wearing different masks and uniforms, to ensure I'm doing the right thing, fitting in, seeming okay. 

I've put on a mask and uniform to help others feel better, be a good friend, a good husband, a good father, a good son. 

I've put on a mask and uniform to numb my pain, to quiet the noise in my head, to tell myself everything is fine. That it will all pass and I have a lot to live for.

I put on a mask and uniform to become addicted to substances to continue the numbing when I couldn't do it anymore on my own. Being consumed with my addiction, to a point I had no regard of my own life.

Now realizing that was not a solution, I've put on another mask and uniform to get me through my recovery over my addiction, depression, self loathing. 

But now when I try to take off this mask and uniform, my face burns from the sun, my body writhes in pain as air touches it. I've never ever learned how to address my real pain... I don't even know what it is... Yet trying to fix it is the most painful part. 

I've been sober for 90 days, I have experienced joyous moments, yet the painful moments are so incredibly intense. I feel like I'm slipping deeper and deeper into my depression... I don't know if I'm lying to myself or not anymore. I feel so lost and feel so much pain, I just want it all to end.",1579997138.0,1.0,0
I don’t feel wanted,"   I don’t know how to start this without sounding whiny or like the typical depressed teenager. I’ve been sitting in complete silence and darkness for a few hours now just thinking. I’m not wanted by anyone. That’s the reoccurring theme of my life. Ever since I was a young child some of my first memories are being told I’m worthless. My 1st grade teacher was the first to say that. Since then all but a handful have held the same opinion and boy do they love to vocalize it when they think I’m not listening. I’m built up with compliments only to overhear that they’re all lies.. I’m not that beautiful girl that they’re lending a helping hand too. I’m that pitiful tranny that they feel bad for.. people say they can relate and it all gets better as if that’s gonna fix anything. I had to drop out of high school because of my depression and the bullying. Nobody wanted me there.. not even the other lgbt kids. I’ve always tried my best to help others. I go out of my way to make others happy only to be ignored when I need a shoulder to cry on. That was over a year and a half ago. I’ve barely left my house since. My body quickly went away. No longer do I have a smooth hourglass with legs that could kill.. now my bones stick out all over.. my abs are so weak that my stomach just hangs out. That’s not all of my issues with my body either.. doctors have made their marks on my most private areas also.. so I can’t feel anything but pain. I feel like I was born to be miserable. Born to watch others live their lives with ups and downs but Im never allowed to be a part of any of it. I’m supposed to spend the rest of my life with no purpose, no love, no hope and no joy. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.. to forget all the miseries of this world. All the pain, the heartache, I want to forget all of that and find solace in the void that awaits. At this point nothingness would be bliss.",1579997010.0,1.0,2
I had to leave the gym early because of how I feel,"I left early because I couldn't focus

I am angry with those who have hurt and disrespected me, it is on my mind nearly every day. I feel shame, sorrow, regret, and anger for not standing up for myself. I feel disappointed that no one helped. It is too late to change anything.

I'm tired of being invalidated, so I don't talk to anyone about it. I keep everything to myself. I have flashes of memories multiple times every waking hour. I haven't felt at peace in several years. Everything in my life has gone wrong, I have made no progress, I am ashamed of who I am, and disappointed in myself and humanity

No amount of small changes will improve anything. I don't believe any of this motivational bullshit. It is too late to make a difference. I wish I had taken action when it mattered. Now I am stuck being this unrespectable mess that I am.

I don't like anything around me. I'm tired of my family/culture, I'm tired of being unemployed, I'm tired of being alone. I don't get along with people because they always seem to want to preach and put me down. This is not a life worth living, I am not someone worth being

I'm feeling the most difficult to understand combination of emotions and I just need to write it out,"I'll turn 30 this year, and I've been struggling with gradually worse and worse issues for at least the past decade. My family has always been pretty emotionally distant and stunted so I've mostly hidden things from them until about a year ago, when finally I just had to lean on my parents and finally let them know just how broken I feel, and how unsure of everything I am, and how I feel I can't even trust my brain to make adequate conclusions. I saw a therapist for years and it only helped to an extent.

As my parents started to understand just how bad things were, they started to become less distant and open up with me just a bit. They've been encouraging me to try going on anti-depressants, but due to a long story I won't go into here, I'm pretty reluctant to go on heavy medication like that. I'm slowly coming around to it, though.

In the past two days, I've had long conversations with both my parents (they've been divorced most of my life, so there was a lot of repeating going on). First my mom dropped a small bomb on me that *she's* been on meds for a good part of my life. And today, my dad dropped a much larger bomb that he's been on them pretty much my entire life, has never been able to totally get off of them, that he was suicidal a couple of times in the past, and that most of my relatives are known to deal with depression and/or have spent most of their adult lives on meds.

I felt like Luke being told that Vader was his father. I've never felt that much of a connection to my family, always felt like the black sheep, the odd emotional one out. And now, I feel this strong sense of a lineage, but connected to the worst parts of me, like they were my birthright all along.

At first I was just totally stunned, unable to put what he had just said into context. Perhaps you'd really need to understand my family dynamic and my place within it more fully to get why this hit me so hard, but it's hard to put into words how much this realization rearranged my understanding of my whole life.

I feel angry that I was more or less guaranteed to inherit mental health issues. That it's basically the elephant in the room in our family, and that, no, they're not emotionally stunted -- they're all depressed, and the only difference between me and them is that I express when they hide. I'm angry that I never knew any of this until now, that they all chose to sweep their problems under the rug and not talk about it, rather than face it openly.

I feel angry at my parents for leaving me to suffer alone, that they didn't tell me earlier. I could have had more time to not feel crazy or scared of telling them what was wrong with me. I could have had more time getting adequate treatment, encouraged by their stories, and I could have avoided some things I've come to truly regret.

I feel scared that I'm doomed to repeat my dad's mistakes; like a lot of men, as I've gotten older I've noticed myself turning into him, and I've seen myself pushing women away in the same way that he did (which ultimately resulted in my parents' divorce, which I've only come to understand in the past year the extent to which it scarred me). I've seen my temper get shorter and snap at people I love (which he said is the symptom of his that keeps him on meds permanently).

He told me that he's always thought that if only he had been on anti-depressants earlier, my mom wouldn't have left him.

I feel relieved that it's not all my fault. That I'm not the odd one out. That I truly didn't choose this, that I didn't really have a choice in the matter. I'm happy to know that maybe I can avoid making my dad's mistakes, even though I've screwed it up with incredible woman after incredible woman thanks to this stuff. I feel thankful that I have proof that meds are demonstrably effective for people with my gene pool, and that maybe I can turn the ship for good.

I feel everything right now. I'm completely overwhelmed.

Me,"I just need to vent, I guess.
I'm sitting here alone in my room. Thinking about everything and nothing. I just looked through some old pictures of class trips and stuff and all these weird feelings came up. I cant really describe it but it weren't comfortable feelings. Unsettling feelings. I saw myself physically in the pictures but it didn't feel like that was really me. And it reminded me that I used to do a lot more than what I did in the last years. I basically just sat in my room and watched youtube videos or so. Day in day out. Time flew by. Now I feel like I wasted all that time but I probably won't change anything. I hate myself. All these thoughts inside my head. In the last years I think I only spoke once to someone about my feelings. I just bottle up everything inside of me. But I feel more and more like I'm about to burst. The last years I let my physical and mental health deteriorate and my parents don't know anything about it. So much stuff accumulated that I don't think I can talk about it anymore. It's just too much. I lied to them for too long. I want this to end but I can't talk to them. Right now I feel like there are only two options: continue living like this or just snap and do something stupid. Snapping sounds so tempting because then I don't have to explain much because everything gets visible at once. Makes it easier for me. But I only feel like this at night. During the day my brain is like ""just do nothing and we're good. There are people that have it much worse"". Fuck, I hate me.

Advice on finding a therapist,"How do I got about finding a therapist? I'm in the US, and I checked with my insurance, and they do cover therapy.

Disconnection from parents,"Over the years I have tried my hardest to mend a relationship with my mother. My childhood and teenage years with her were rough. Truly a struggle, due to her irrational and manipulative ways. The emotional abuse was strong and I did not realize this until I was in my late teens. Her never leaving the bed, not being able to be fully present, just coasting through. Severely depressed along with severe mood swings. I was an only child, and took the verbal abuse of being told I was a bastard when she disagreed with me. Told me she will love me because I am her son but hates the person that I became to be. I heard those words for the first time at 16, it was not the only time. I look back now and realize how I as a parent would never be able to speak those words to a child. I realize those words trigger a lot of my anxiety and deep fear of not being good enough. I am living the repercussions of her irrational behavior as an adult and trying my best to be my best self and not be like her. On top of trying to please her with a relationship for her well being which is absolutely draining.

I don’t know what will come of from posting this, I know I’m not alone in this boat. I just don’t know how to cope sometimes with it all. Being a sponge of her rollercoaster of emotions. The obligation to feel bad is so hard to ignore, but I have been affected so greatly, and she js just blind to it all. 

Toxic relationships with parents are so hard to cope with, you feel lonely. Always. I just need help and someone to talk to. I can’t connect with her at all, I have no desire to see her, talk to her. I love her for everything she gave me and did for me, but there is such underlying resentment for what I also was forced to go through.",1579992422.0,0.76,1

"One of my closest friends tried to get me arrested. This is a long post, so feel free to ignore it.","I still can't believe it. Skip ahead to the Molester Moon emoji for the reason the story is relevant to my depression.

He stole $11,000 worth of merchandise from my old workplace. Right before he did it, he texted me that he quit his job because the boss and manager kept “disrespecting him”. I told him I admired that he didn't take shit from anyone. Later that day, my old boss texted me, knowing that we were such close friends, telling me that if my friend didn't call him within five minutes, he was going to involve police over an issue that he didn't disclose. I spam texted my friend, worried for him, and I told him what my boss said. He didn't reply. I continued to tell him how worried I was, and that I'd always have his back.

The next day, my boss called me to tell me that my friend had told the police that I taught him how to steal from the store, that I encouraged him to do it, that I stole tons of merch myself, and finally that I had planned a damn heist with him. None of this is true. I once put a piece of merch valued at about three bucks  in my pocket, intending to put it back on the shelf, but I forgot and took it home and never got around to bringing it back to the store. I once mentioned a blind spot in the store cameras where you can't see what customers might steal, but I mentioned that simply out of annoyance at a customer who did steal from us. That might be the extent of my ""teaching him how to steal"".

[I texted him very politely, asking him what was going 
on](https://imgur.com/a/dcILzR7), but he had blocked me. I saw later that he'd blocked me on everything else as well. 

###🌚

This guy and I spent hours together. He gave me gifts all the time. He shared expensive drugs with me. We opened up to each other about everything. I always came to him with problems. We introduced our friends to each other. To think that this is how it all ended is insane to me. I still just cannot believe it. It has hurt me to no end. I have never felt this betrayed. 

But when it was all happening, I realized how much I deserved it. I've cheated on one of the sweetest and most caring people I've ever met. I've lied to close companions simply for attention. I attempted suicide by convincing myself that that was the only was to get people to remember me for good things as opposed to any of the other horrible things I've done. I am such a piece of shit that even my closest friends can betray me without skipping a beat. And that must be why I've lost so many close friends in the past three years.

This realization has been extremely eye-opening. The worst part is that I know I can't change. 

I hate being one of those people who blames their mental illness(es) for the shit they do, but I'm certain that my manic phases will forever hurt anyone with whom I might have a relationship. The voices in my head whisper that it doesn't matter if people get hurt because we'll all die in a matter of decades.

There's a panel in the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure where a character >|opens up a portal to the past to keep himself from getting shot, causing the bullet to fly through the portal and violently explode a guy's head in the 1800s or so. His best friend and he are alone in the middle of a desert, and his best friend has no idea what's happened — he just watched his closest, dearest friend's head explode and he screams in utter agony and despair as the chunks of brain and skull splatter against his face.|< When I read that, I felt little to no sympathy for the surviving friend. I've asked around, and nobody else felt sympathy for him either. Recently, I realized why — it was because it happened so long ago. It was only a matter of centuries ago, but they already don't matter to us. What were their names? It doesn't matter. They are long gone. And we will end up the same way one day. Our lives and emotions are pointless because they are fleeting. This is what the voices in my head whisper to me as I hurt people. This is what the nonexistent beings around me tell me as I walk past them.

So I definitely deserve this pain. I will always deserve this, because my brain will forever try to convince itself that it doesn't matter if I do the things I've done, because sometimes it will inevitably succeed. I've hurt one of the most wonderful and purest people I've ever met, and now I stay away from them. And although my heart aches over it every passing minute, I know this person is better off without me. They deserve much better. I deserve this heartache.

I wish I had succeeded in my former suicide attempt. If only the person I love and hurt the most would have realized how much I deserved to have been successful with that, because they were the only reason I wasn't able to go through with it. Once I run out of memes to post, I think I might go through with it. 

This is a long post, so I can't blame you if you don't read it.

This week I had my first good day in 3 months,"I’ve been stuck massively in my own head lately, and my depressed and anxious thoughts have really taken me over to the point that I think I’ve lost myself more than ever before, I’ve had lifelong depression but this episode has been the worst of my life.

I skipped an important commitment early in the week, and seriously considered suicide, the next day I dragged myself in and had a horrible day where I once again wanted to give up and just kill myself, this has been an ongoing cycle for months.

But on Thursday I pulled myself in again, and I got a bit of encouragement from somebody which gave me a push, and I pushed myself and felt like a part of me that was lost came out for the first time in months, I was assertive, I took risks and made decisions for myself, and at the end of the day I felt good about myself and my day, which I have not felt in a long long time and at times thought I may never feel again.

The next day was not as great, but I am going to keep fighting, and having had that one short glimpse that a person still exists beyond my illness has had an indescribable impact.

I genuinely thought I could never be happy again, that I could never be useful to anybody, that I could never live any kind of a life outside of this depression ever again, and I’m still very much deep into this depressive episode, but somewhere deep inside there is still a person that can be reached, and knowing that is a big deal, even if I take a bunch of backwards steps now, which I probably will, there is still something worth fighting for, I had completely given up on that, and one good day showed me that.",1579991150.0,0.81,2

Advice needed,"So I'm struggling with depression quite a while now and no-one seems to care.. I don't even know where to start. Little story first: I had to use some meds because I got sick and side effects kicked in, I couldn't breathe normally and I was about to get a heart attack (had a pulse of ~180bpm). So I was laying in my room and took all the strength I had left to try to call people.. everyone just hung up on me because everything I just could do was some kind of moaning. Took about 2.3 hours for someone to call my brother to check on me.. So my brother arrived and all he was doing was to tell me I shouldn't act like that and things like that... This took about another 30 min till he finally called an ambulance ( yes I could have tried to call one by myself, but I was panicking and couldn't think straight). Doctor told me later that I got lucky and that I have could died that day. ( no-one of my family or friends checked on me in the meanwhile I was at the hospital)..

I was too tired to visit my dad - now feeling incredibly upset and guilty,"I'm diagnosed with severe depressive disorder and anxiety. currently on Citalopram. My sleep has been pretty miserable, nightmare-filled and broken, and last night I was up till about 6am due to anxiety.  

I was supposed to get up at 9am to get the bus with my brother to our dad's (we visit him once a week since he lives 1h30m away) but when my brother woke me up, I was just too tired and sad to get out of bed.

I finally went back to sleep and woke up around 6pm, feeling really guilty and ashamed that I didn't fight the bad feelings and just go and see him. When I was in hospital, he'd travel like 3 hours, often alone, to come see me and he's done so much for me, and I couldn't even get out of fucking bed to see him for a few hours??! I feel so pathetic and shit.

Can anyone tell me if Citalopram has made their anxiety worse (started 10mg a month ago, 20mg 3 weeks ago) and messed up their sleep? I'm becoming nocturnal now because I have no will to wake myself up at a reasonable time.

I know technically it isn't my fault for being too tired to see my dad, but I just feel so awful. I am 2 months free from self-harm and the temptation is so strong, but I just can't resort back to that.

I feel like I’m exaggerating,"This morning I was on my way with my mom and siblings to visit my grandma in her new house. About a year ago, her husband died. She had been alone all her life and found him, only to have him taken away from her 3 years later. 

Before this, I had a driving lesson. Driving might be one of the things I detest the most. I hate it. I had also overslept, so I enjoyed it even less. Besides that I was having a bad morning. 

During the car ride, my mom casually asked me how my driving lesson was. Usually I tell her that it was fun, alrighty or fine. This time I decided to be honest and tell her that I didn’t enjoy it, because I was very tired. For the most part because of my depression. 

She responded in a way that kind of hurt me. “You were tired? That’s no excuse. You should’ve gone to bed earlier, it’s your own fault. Tell that to grandma, she has a right to be tired. You should learn to not complain about minor things like that, it’s selfish.” Something along those lines. 

It hurt me. I want to open up to my family, but it feels like they will act like I am exaggerating. I just feel so misunderstood and alone.

I wonder when I'll break again,"Just after graduating high school, I did much of nothing. I played videogames, sketched, masturbated, and watched YouTube for 14-18 hours a day. This went on from my summer after graduating until about April, so close to a year.

I ate roughly once a day, usually just a bowl of ramen. I did not help around the house at all or even take care of myself. Showering every few days was my limit of self care.

It's been four years. I still have mdd. I just experience it differently. My pessimistic ways were replaced with nihilistic indifference until I hit the end recently. 

The utter shutdown of genuine emotional response and giving up on my emotional well being.

There is no point in trying to beat a treatment resistant case of depression, as far as I'm concerned. There is no point in talking about because people can't relate and are unaware and insensitive to others struggles. There is no point in getting better.

This is the new unsustainable baseline that will permeate my mid to late twenties.

I fully expect to live alone. I certainly wouldn't put up with the real me. An insufferable, empty soul who wants to be fixed but won't put in the effort on his own.

Nobody will ever invest in me so I won't invest in myself. I won't invest in myself so the cycle will continue.

I live a normal blaise life. Work, gym, college, videogames, programming, and occasionally going out with coworkers. I'm comfortable, my needs besides intimacy and mental health are mostly met.

Nowadays, especially in the media, there seems to be such a focus of mental illness. I know this should make me happy that something I struggle with is being discussed, but it does quite the opposite, actually.

So I just joined like 30 seconds ago.,"I’ve suffered from the classic three - stress, anxiety and depression - for about 10 years now. Not sure why it started but I only realised it about 4 years ago, when I went back to university at the age of 36. The coursework and the difficulty in making friends (because of my age I think) while seeing everyone else there having a good time, made me question why I wasn’t happy. I also went about 10yrs without being in a relationship before meeting someone online and have a (very) long distance one, I ended that earlier this month because she never had time for me and kept making promises to come see me, which she would break (she didn’t want me to visit her because of her family). 
I’ve felt pretty useless for a while. Other people my age are in relationships, have kids, are in long term jobs that pay well etc. They’ve mostly met someone and settled down. Something I haven’t done, and I keep wondering why. What is wrong with me to deserve this? Why won’t the universe give me what it’s given them?
I also suffer from some pretty serious medical issues (hidden ones) so y confidence has never been high because of those.

Last year was pretty shitty and I don't really have anybody to talk to,"I think I hit my rock bottom last year. I know that that'd mean I can only go up now, but it's hard to be hopeful.

It started with my exams, which were just super stressful. I had a breakdown in front of my teacher where I'd just be laughing-crying hysterically and pulling out my hair and they didn't react to it at all. Spent like half an hour or more afterwards locking myself up in the bathroom and nobody bothered to check up on me. Not long after I boned two dudes merely because I was curious what it'd be like with others. Turns out that sex means absolutely  nothing to me if love isn't involved and boy, do I regret that, do I feel so, so bad and disgusting for it. Shaved my hair off shortly after the second guy because???? I looked even twice as ugly as I already did and still whine about how I miss my long hair, boohoo I'm dumb af. Had a fight with a long time online friend (fortunately we're on alright terms now again, but we don't really talk as much as we did before) which made me feel super bad. Boyfriend got ""appendicitis"" which turned out to be lymphatic cancer. I'm still jobless after 40+ applications. Had a poor excuse of a suicide attempt that landed me a night in IC, because I was fucking stupid and called the doctor cause I guess my ass didn't seriously want to die or something? Really regret calling. On benefits now 'cause I can't leech off bf's money. Boyfriend staying with his parents in between chemo's because I can't take care of him and don't have a license so can't drive him to the hospital and stuff. Had a fight with his parents that I still feel bad about and I often can't push away the thought that his parents don't like me. Boyfriend kind of falling in own depression pattern again now that he doesn't have much to do making him get grumpy at me a lot, which stings. Probably got even fatter this year as well and my skin has gotten pretty bad. Kinda falling into a rabbithole of selfharm pics now and then, kind of making me afraid I'm gonna do some bad shit to myself someday and frankly have that nagging feeling of wanting to fuck up my face. Quit therapy last fall as well because it was going nowhere and probably starting up a different one this year, if they'll have me because from what I gathered I have to ""really want to get better"" but I don't even know how to want it because it always makes me feel like I guess I can't do anything then, if I really need to want it. I don't trust myself, I'm not reliable. I really can't trust myself. Lately I've been feeling a lot like maybe I don't exist at all.

I know it's not the worst and all that stuff, but I'm just really lonely and don't have people to share this sort of stuff with and it just keeps weighing me down if I don't write it down somewhere. I always feel like I'm just rambling into the void and I probably am, I just wish the void would talk back.",1579984089.0,0.76,6

I probably should have posted a decade ago but I didn't.,"I'm 31 now. I feel like most of the last decade which probably should have been the best years of my life has been burned out sitting behind a monitor because I got too into my head after some bad times. I'm not sure if I regret it and it kind of scares me.

Often, I get dreams where I'm fading away in a hospital bed with nobody there for me as I'm leaving. It's terrifying and it's starting to feel like it's going to be a reality one day..  it's my fault.

I ghosted every single person I knew IRL outside of my immediate family. This was about 7-10 years ago. I didn't like where my life was and most of the people in it. I wanted to have a clean slate with a new place, new people, and start a different life. I never got out and gave it a chance.

It wasn't always like this. I used to have loads of friends and was always in relationships. The one constant is that always been at war with myself for no reason. It's just on a new high now.

So, I'm still here. Years and years later. Behind a monitor.

Eventually I ended up getting a great job that benefited from my shut-in life. I have enough money to buy pretty much any car I want, enough to travel anywhere, enough to start almost anything anywhere. I'm frozen.

I'm still living in the same area where I grew up. Terrified of going outside(rarely do it) and running into people that I used to know. I'd probably be fucked without amazon prime, haha. I wouldn't be able to take it if I ran into someone I knew who saw the deteriorated me. It would be the one thing that would break me.. seeing people I used to know doing so much god damn better than me. I never gave a fuck about anything when I was younger. What happened?

I know everyone is on their own timeline. It's just so hard to forget mine and move on.

Lately I've come to find happiness pretty often. Even inside my bubble of nothing. Thinking that maybe my life is fine if I simply exist and do a bit of good for people every here and there. I'm getting more content than ever and I wish I could really truly hate it. I have brothers who have disabilities who I'll probably have to take care of one day. I won't be able to do it like this. I care about them more than anything and my biggest fear is leaving them behind with nobody to love and care for them when my parents are gone. I can't keep fucking doing this..

What kind of consequences are associated with disclosing suicidal ideation to a mental health professional?,"I've been googling but I figured I'd ask here as well. If one goes to see a psychologist or psychiatrist and mentions having suicidal thoughts, will this have a discernible effect on one's life?

From what I understand, you're not going to be committed or anything unless they think you're an immediate danger to yourself and can't be left alone for any amount of time. But will admitting to suicidal ideation follow you around in your life? Is there some sort of line you can cross that will get you labeled as mentally defective or as a danger to yourself and others? Can it show up in background checks and affect your eligibility for things like security clearances, purchasing firearms, or obtaining special licenses for who-knows-what?

"Hi, everyone.","This is the first post I've made to this subreddit, and Reddit in general. I've been struggling with depression for about 4 years now, but I was only diagnosed about 3 months ago. I've been feeling the lowest I've ever felt. I've been suicidal before, but not like this, so fucking lost. I have a girlfriend, and great friends, and I'm currently in therapy, but somehow, I still just want to end everything. I wrote a suicide note about 4 years ago, too, but even then, I didn't feel as low as I'm feeling now. I don't know what to do.",1579982155.0,1.0,0
i want to be alone and away,"i just read a post that i really related to, something along the lines of “depression makes me selfish and lazy”. i just want everyone to be away,i should be the only person who has to deal with myself because all i do is hurt other people. i’m not enough for anyone and i’m so over torturing myself to please other people. i seriously do not care about making my parents proud nor anyone around me. i will do what i want and i don’t care about the consequences because there’s no point to anything anyways. the only thing I’ve ever looked forward to in future life was having children but i don’t even think I’ll ever be fit as a parent. i’m too far unstable to care after another human i can’t even care for myself. there really is no purpose to anything anymore i have nothing to lose and that is such a terrible feeling.",1579981801.0,0.67,0

21 years old and completely losing himself,"I’m 21 now. I’m healthy enough. Athletic enough. Happy enough with my looks. But here I am. Drinking enough to get a crazy high off bud then drinking more and repeating every second of my free time. I have no one. No family. I’ve been betrayed cheated and lied to by every last soul. 

2 years of this. Every single day except maybe 2 or 3. I don’t know how I do it. 12 pack a night mixed with at least an 1/8. And getting worse.

Is your family mentally unwell?,"Hi everyone! I have depression and have suffered from it for as a long as I can remember. I was bullied since I was 8 and remember having the worst fear of going through the gates to get to class. Then life just started to pile on. As I was growing up I started to notice my other family members were “not right”. My mum suffered from agoraphobia for 2 years.  Now I believe she has something else wrong. She sleeps all day and uses other people stories as her own. She also believes everything she reads in magazines and always warns me of the “dangers” she read about. Sounds harmless which it is but it’s very strange the way she talks about it. My brothers all battled drug addiction growing up. Some are better and living a better life but now some are alcohol dependant and still drug addicts. My sister has bipolar. I just wanted to ask the question, if your family is unwell, has that caused a flow on effect to make you mentally unwell or increase the severity you illness is?

How much do I let my friends help?,"So maybe this is an odd title.   But here's the basic circumstances.  I have been in a really bad mood for a while.  partly my fault, I forgot to take my meds for like a month and a half.  and my friends are super supportive and want to help me, especially until I can get an appointment with a therapist.  

The issue is, I know that however much they help me it won't make a real difference.  it might make me feel better while we're talking but as soon as we stop i'll be just as bad as I was before we started.  So how much is it okay to lean on my friends, when i know that it won't make a serious difference, when I know that they can't possibly give me the time that I need, ect ect.  I lost some friends before by being too needy, and I don't want to lose any more.

I dont know what to do anymore so ill leave this here,"I feel a lil bit selfish talking about how I feel, maybe there are others that need more help than me, but i cant take it anymore...I’ve started to feel a deep pain in my chest, like someone is crushing me inside. My heart is beating faster than normal, and I feel like im having an anxiety strike all day long.. Mostly, I try to distract myself during the day by reading or learning..but at the end of the day, when I finally reach my bed I’m realising that i feel so alone...and i end up crying..and I cant stop..
I tried to seek help in others, but while i was trying to explain i felt like they we re acusing me for beeing melodramatic..
For example, today I finally made the effort to leave my house to feel better.. drinking a coffee or something..so i decided to ask my friend out, but she had plans today..and i felt wrecked inside..idk why..like that was the only chance to get out of this...
Man, since then i felt like shit.. all i wanted was someone to hug me and tell me its going to be alright..(im going though a hard school time, full of exams and stuff like this, and maybe is because im stressed as well)... my parents are far away from me..my boyfriend is also miles away..

I’m a selfish person,"I haven’t cleaned my room in months and every time my mom asks me to help, I just can’t make myself do anything. Now there has been more and more days that I would just rather lay in my bed watching pointless shows rather than getting up and doing something helpful or productive. 
The worst part is I don’t even know where all of these come from - I had a pretty good childhood; always had food, loving family, enough friends. The only thing that brought me down was my dad who would constantly yell at me for things I wound be able to control since I was little at the time. Now I just get anxiety whenever someone’s yell at me but that still  doesn’t explain why I began giving up that much.  I’m so tired of being this shitty selfish person who has no motivation to do anything! I really want to get back on track but I have no clue how. I have also asked my mom to get me a therapist but she didn’t really listen to me and I genuinely don’t know how to find one myself. 
Whenever I go out with my friends, I like it at first but they never want to do anything interesting like go to a museum or a park whether they are busy or have no money which is I see less and less reasons to go out with them. All we do is what I can do by myself- sit around and watch movies.

Two weeks ago, my depression started to get worse and the bad thoughts started creeping in.

I live in a wealthy country in Europa (France). Full welfare, hey. 

I live in my mother house. We are not rich but not poor.  (My father is alive too, they just don't live together).

I screw up my studies last years. I did a unemployement training and find a good job, and start evening studies. 

&#x200B;

So, economically, it's not bad. 

My work is great, especialy for a degreless. My colleague are nice. Pay is good, schedule too.

Somes people tell me it's my new job. But it's not niews, i always felt tired and weak. 

I expected it would change when grow up, take responsability, ykn, normal life. But no. And i don't understand why i always so energyless.

I worked hard, i red a lot, i tried to act smartly, so, why after 10 years, i feel that i turned around during 15 f\*\*\* years? 

All i see is success. Great degree, great salaries, great skill, great shape and cute face. Well, not me. And i know, i know it's pure work, i know that for most of them they earn it. But i wonder, why i couldn't? Why did i have so few willpower? So few energy? It's still the case !

Regret is the worst feeling,"So I am Gonna Tell My Story. So Since The Beginning I am an introvert, I mean a big big level introvert. I had a phobia from going to school & I just couldn't fit in there with students & always tried to skip it. And I was attending school just 3 4 times in 2 months was very bad as studying. No interest in anything then attendance become a Compulsory thing and I quit school. Tbh at that time I was feeling like a superman and was feeling so happy that I am at home while others at school, I would watch tv, sleep and enjoy seeing others going to school and me being at home as if that was some accomplishments. Parents tried their best but then they gave up on me. But I was growing up , getting ridiculed at everywhere we went. Then when I reached 15 My father said do something and he put me in an NIOS ( National Institute Of Open Schooling) and I did my high school from there - then did my 12th from there as well. Then I decided I will not study any further as I was hardly passing the exams & I had a serious ohobia from college because of attending class so I skipped it. But my father said at least do distance learning so I enrolled myself in B.A IN COMMUNICATIVE ENGLISH From Distance Education. But the problem is I have never went ti school, college, have no friends at all, my qualifications are worst, resume is embarrassing. Distance learning is has a bad value.

None of these things are appealing It has been hard to have a boyfriend, because I don´t somehow believe that he finds me attractive My boyfriend and friends have said: ´´ believe in yourself, say positive things about yourself´´

But for me that is just not realistic. Think of an actress/actor that you think looks one hundred procent unattractive. Done it? Now imagine you waking up and seeing that face in the mirror. And then your hear advice from people saying that you should say positive things about your looks and find yourself attractive. I don´t see how that is realistic.",1579978778.0,0.72,2
Hit my lowest point this year,"Start of the second semester of school and already I hate it.

I suffer from depression (no shit), anxiety, ADD, and have been going through the process of being tested for aspergers/high functioning autism.  Because of these things, I have a very hard time focusing on and completing tasks, being in social situations, and being confronted with failure.

Normally I'm an average/above average student in school.  But this first semester I barely passed my classes, and I fear I'm repeating the same cycle in the new semester as well.  I barely completed homework assignments due to inattentiveness and depressive apathy.  Most of the time I turned in classwork/homework late or uncompleted.  I drew away from my friends, and they haven't really noticed.  We're still good friends and we still hang out, but I feel like they don't notice when I'm gone.  I was planning to apply to a prestigious school this year, but with my grades I know I'm not getting in.  Most days I feel like I'm in a haze, and barely in the present.  Most things I used to do barely give me any joy (dev work, writing, reading, gaming, etc.) and seem more like a chore to do.  My parents are constantly hounding me to do my work (my dad suffers from ADD as well and doesn't want me to fail like he did) and take things away from me if I have low grades.  They do it because they say I'm negatively motivated, which I know is true and I hate that it is. I want to tell them that I'm not and I can change, but negative motivation is all that gets me to work hard nowadays.  I hate having what I like get taken away from me, it makes everything feel 10x worse, but it's the only way I do anything anymore, and I know that's true.  I'm having my phone confiscated due to my failing grades, and I'm nervous to ask for a replacement for my broken laptop (I'm currently using my old school-issued one instead) because I think I don't deserve it.  I know I don't deserve it.

I end up crying most days, to the point where I've stopped marking my calendar when it happens because it's become a daily occurrence.  I find little to no joy being at school or at home, and I have suicidal thoughts on a near-daily basis.  I'd never go through with killing myself because my parents are trying to help as much as possible, and I can't bear to make them go through the grief.  I know they want to help me and are reaching out to me, but I feel so trapped inside myself that I can't talk to them.  I miss my therapist, and I can't talk to her anymore since she moved away.

All I'm doing anymore is trying to get something done to get my grades up.  I'm burrowing into my work and hiding away again.  I just want this to get better, but it's only getting worse.",1579978760.0,0.67,0

Years of Depression,"I'm a 25 year old gay male and have been fighting with depression for as long as I can remember now. This all probably started at about 15 years old when I came out and my mother more or less disowned me at the time because of it. She said some of the most horrendous things I've ever heard in my life. We still talk today and she has apologised for how she went on but it is something that lasted for probably about 5 years until I was about 20 year old. I still don't feel like I'm over it. Should I be? Or is this something that could have lasting implications on my mental health throughout the rest of my life?

Being a lost delinquent I got addicted to various drugs over the years to try and mask the fact that I hated my life and myself for not being able to be the person that my parents wanted me to be. They have always been pushy and still are to this day and it has made me feel worthless being unable to achieve what they want me to.I have had counselling and help with drugs and have been off hard drugs for well over a couple of years now but I am still left feeling empty and devoid of life. 

Over the last year or so I have had a lot of suicidal thoughts (not of actually commiting the act) but rather a voice in my head that keeps telling me that I wish I was dead. I've just had somebody in my life hang themselves and they were basically the same demographic as me (same age, same sexuality etc.) and it has resonated with me quite particularly. The only thing that I feel that stops me from entertaining the idea of suicide is how much pain it would bring to the people around me. But it's hard to have any enthusiasm for life when the only reason you feel like you're still here is to prevent the pain of others.

Is it possible that I could be depressed?,"Hey there everyone! Not looking to diagnose, just if anyone else has experienced something similar. I apologize if this became a vent a little bit too. I don't really have anyone else to talk too right now. 

I've had a huge course of events going on for the last two months. I've been separated from my wife because I'm struggling financially among lots of other stuff like trouble being honest about finances or my schoolwork (dropping out without telling anyone because I couldn't keep up). So now I'm just living by myself making do with what I can. I currently work in car sales, and lately, I have major trouble staying motivated to do pretty much anything. I've been in a major funk where I haven't been selling anything, and not making any money in return. The days that I do manage to be productive to make appointments, they have all been no shows or just no sales in the end because of if crazy customer expectations. It's gotten to the point where I don't even wanna take the walk-in customers whereas I used to be the one waiting for it. I just let another sales guy take it even when they literally offer it to me. I've also been burying myself at work, working full shifts Monday-Saturday working 72 hour weeks. It's just to keep myself occupied since I don't really have much else to do with my time. I don't have any real friends to reach out too, to talk or even just hang out with. It's very alone like feeling. 

As far as eating goes, I've been trying to do meal prep to save money which in turn is working versus eating out all the time, but now I'm only eating once a day and it's just feeling like I'm doing it to not starve. I used to be eating a breakfast lunch and dinner a day. Now it's just once a day at lunch.

Did my personality die? I miss myself. I’m tired of saying I’m fine to make people feel at ease so here’s the whole thing. Safe venting place :),"Hello internet strangers whom I want to be honest with instead of my friends and family :)
I think that’s why we’re all here. It’s hard to tell people you’re depressed. We might not want to worry them or think they won’t understand (it’s hard even for me to understand). So strangers will do. I thank you for reading and hope you can understand I need to vent and be honest for once.

I’m a cook and I used to really love cooking. I was an extrovert who really liked to have fun and making plans and meeting new people. Reading that makes me feel like I’m talking about a different person. It’s hard to put into words but I feel like “that me” died already. I can barely remember her. I can’t remember what made her laugh or brought her joy anymore. I can’t remember the last time I genuinely laughed without faking, I remember I used to cry laugh all the time! It was a thing of mine, I can remember it felt amazing. I can almost start to feel something in my stomach as I think back and try to think of me being happy but it goes away before I can remember. 
If I could just remember what the things that brought me joy were, I would be able to try and get myself back. I miss me.

Anyway, I’m a cook. The reason why this is important is because I believe it was a cooking accident that kick-started making me feel...nothing. My personality type is INFP (empath or peacemaker) so it was very noticeable, for me at least, going from feeling everything for everyone to literally feeling nothing. We were making some pot brownies and we were already kind of blazed, so I didn’t notice the stovetop was slightly on. And when I used the Pam spray for the mold the spray caught on fire and made its way to the nozzle and made the can explode. I had second degree burns on my hands and face, and a third degree burn on my neck. After I got discharged from the hospital and started my recovery back home I noticed I felt so numb. I thought it was the pain meds. 

Fast forward a year and I had quit culinary school, lost communication with a lot of friends and spent that whole year in bed. I decided to get help and started therapy. Which helped. I still wasn’t diagnosed though. After 6 months of therapy I was diagnosed and treated with 10mg of escilatopram a day. I might have felt a little better at the start but after a while I became and presently am a zombie. I can’t explain it.
I didn’t like feeling like a zombie but I couldn’t really remember how I felt before the treatment. Worse or better? So I just stuck to the lexapro.

It’s been a year and a half since then. I moved alone to a different country to continue to cook. I’ve been here since august 2019. At first the excitement  of leaving my parents house, living abroad alone and learning to cook again was enough to really make me feel like I was doing better. Like if the cure was just to move and start again. But as soon as I started getting used to the routine I could feel myself slipping back. It’s been a month since I’ve last been to class, and it’s been three months of isolating myself from any sort of social situation. But I still prefer being there than at home. At least here I can hide in my cave without worrying my family and just tell them I’ve been to class and out.

I’ve come back home now for a short visit, I saw my doctor today after not seeing him since July and I don’t know what happened but I was honest for once. I told him I was getting up at 2-3pm to make the days last less, only having one meal a day, only leaving the apartment to walk my dog, haven’t made a single friend and worst of all I feel nothing about it. No pressure, no sadness, nothing. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I am just throwing away and can’t even feel bad about it. I want to punch myself in the face and scream COME BACK! WAKE UP! 

I was really hoping he would switch  the lexapro to something else but he decided to keep me on it for now. He also added something new I haven’t tried, it’s called modafinil. I’m quite nervous. Last time I started taking something for my mental health it turned me into an empty zombie. Have any of you guys tried this mix? How did you feel? Are you better? Are you worse? 

Since I’ve spent three years lying and saying I’m fine, I would like to fully complain in this last  paragraph. Ahem
- I feel dumber than before

-I can’t remember anything anymore

-I haven’t had sex in THREE YEARS

-I have no interest in having sex or meeting a partner.

-I lie to people to make THEM feel ok about MY depression.

-I have gained weight.

-I get nervous talking to people now, to the point where I stutter.

-having a conversation doesn’t feel “organic” anymore, I have to try hard to think what to say next instead of just listening and flowing.

- I’m failing in school.

-I reply to messages 3-7 days later (even if I read them) I don’t know what causes me to do this but my friends definitely don’t appreciate it.

-I worry lately if I’ll feel like this forever

I know this is long, so if you made it this far I really appreciate it. If you feel venting will be good for you too, share your story if you’re ready! I’d be happy to read about all of you!
If you have any information about modafinil I’d be really greatful! Any tips on how to cure depression are welcome to be forgotten tomorrow. But still appreciated today.

I hope you are taking care of yourself as best you can. And I truly hope we can find ourselves again someday. In the mean time it was nice finding this subreddit today :) I think I’ve enjoyed being honest and hope you can too! 
I care for all of you and hope you have an easier day tomorrow!

i have a problem with my therapist,"I have been in therapy for about half a year and i've discovered, that im just not realy comfortable talking to my therapist. I have two major reasons for that the first one is that i'm just not comfortable talking to anyone but my closest friends about how bad my mental state realy is. And the second one is that i don't think that she realy understands how my depression feels. When I started therapy I i was a lot more comfortable talking to her but then i realised, that she just doesn't really understand how I feel and that lead to me being less confortable talking to her and not telling her how bad my state really is. And now I'm trapped in this vicious cycle of being less and less comfortable talking to her which leads to me lying to her which makes her understand me less which makes me less comfortable talking to her. I don't think getting a new therapist will help because in my expirience no one who doesn't have depression can really understand what it's like.

I would really apreciate some advice from you guys becausei can't go on like this but have no idea what I should do

Worried of everything with bad social skills and shyness.,"All I have been thinking about the past 2 weeks.  
I'm currently 16.  
I'm very introverted and shy with almost no social skills. I stay away from everyone. Getting bullied all the time.  
That's why from a young age I have thought about video games,the internet or PC's being an escape from that.   
However that lead to me being really overweight and again no social skills.   
On top of that I have realized I'm 16 and getting close to finishing school and thought to myself how will I ever get a wife or even girlfriend since I've never really been in a relationship or a life in general with actual friends ?   
On top of many medical problems effecting relationships.  
What if my parents pass away and i have no family of my own ?  
Sitting there depressed. Been thinking about this for weeks.  
I cant change it. I cant be normal and hanging out with people.   
Most people in this country like smoking,drugs,parties and ect ect.   
I cant do it. I dont wanna do this. I dont know anyone IRL so I have no incentive to go out.  
I mean what do I do ? Go out and walk around the street asking for friends ?   
Im hoping Uni might fix stuff. Maybe I find a girl or friends with common interests.   
But im losing hope every day more and more.  
I feel like I dont wanna talk about anything of this with my parents.  
I'm awaiting to finish high school and then try to tackle life myself.",1579974283.0,0.76,1
"False hope, false happiness.","I really don't know where to start, but I just had my own breakdown literally infront of my family and opened up to them on how they made me feel like I'm a piece of sh*t, and they don't feel like sh*t after saying those hurtful words. I was put on the hospital last year, 1 week after the new school year started, after I failed my s***de attempt.

My family is confused on why I did that and they literally blame each other and point fingers to one another, and they showed me love at that time when I was at the Hospital. I was given some meds to cure my anxiety and depression. I dropped out at my school and I was recovering at that time very quickly, because they showed me that they really cared about me. They talked to me more nicely now, give me comfort, and they really showed me the ""change"" that I want for my Family. I was feeling very hopeful at thise times...

Days goes by, me and my older siblings fight alot. But siblings always fight right? (which is definitely normal) but one thing that made me disgusted is that they said that I was using my depression as an excuse to everything. My older sister questioned my sexuality because I listen to Taylor Swift. (Which is definitely what you want doesn't 'pick' your sexuality). They told me I was a dirtbag because I dropped out at school, etc...

7 months later, I just realized that those medicines doesn't help at all, I feel like they do tricks to your brain to make you feel more ""hopeful"" and ""happier"". I still take those medicines up to this day, and I just realized I need to stop taking those because they are not helping at all...",1579974255.0,0.76,1

Temporomandibular joint dysfunction,"(Sorry for the bad english)

 I am 19 years old and I have suffered from TMJD since I was 16. Every time I look for some kind of a cure, I am told that it does not exist and that I will have to live with it forever. Because of this I have suffered a lot, my parents left me aside saying that it is cool or that it passes with time, and I can't work to pay the treatment because of the pain and the few doctors I visited seemed to be indifferent to my situation. With that, the only thing I can think for some months ago is suicide.

 Everything I do at home makes me anxious because of the discomfort, and on the street I feel like crying. It is horrible to know that everything I do from now on will be like this and with each passing thing it gets worse and it seems that it becomes more irreversible.

 So, I kinda don't know what to do, I can't treat myself and I don't have anyone to help me, here in Brazil the public health system can't do anything about it, the only thing I can do is lie down and listen my grandparents say that God will heal me or something.  No matter who I tell about the problem, they don't take it seriously and always use examples of people in a ""worse"" situation.

Is it bad that I want to get sick?,"Suicidal thoughts come to me in waves. But when they come, they’re intense. What stops me from actually committing suicide is my personality. I’m the type of person who hates inflicting pain on others, especially because I know how it feels to feel deep pain. I could never put my mother through that. I would never want my mother to think she failed to help me or anything of that sort. In addition, I live with my mom while my dad and my sister are in another country, I could never leave my mother alone. I will never put pain on my mother. Also Im a very selfless person. I don’t want people who are critically ill to see me commit suicide and be angry that my healthy life was wasted. So, I am suicidal but I won’t do it. But, about two years ago I found two lumps in my right breast. And let me tell you how happy I was. I was so happy. I thought god had answered my prayers and gave me an easy way out of life. I thought it was going to be cancer and I could just naturally die so that no one would be blamed for my death and it wouldn’t be a selfish death. Sadly, that wasn’t the case. But my lumps are continuing to gradually grow so there’s still hope for that easy way out. 

I’m sorry if I sound insensitive towards people who are actually suffering from critical illnesses, I’m not trying to offend anyone.

I’ve been thinking about this for a very long time and just always wanted to tell someone about it. But I don’t have anyone to talk to about my depression, plus nine years of it is a little too much for anyone to handle. Please allow me to just rant a little on here if that’s ok.

Being ghosted feels fucked up,"I don't know if this is the right sub but I feel like shit so I guess it fits.
I'm 23 years old and had the first glance for the chance for a relationship about month ago. For maybe 3 years I'm living with dysthymia now and it pretty much sucks but I always felt like it could be worse, well now it became worse. 
There is this girl in my life and we have been friends for 10+ years. She has a boyfriend and lives in a different city so this was always a problem. I have feelings for her for quite some time now but never explored these feelings because of the reasons above. A month ago she started to get closer to me and gave some obvious signs that she wants more than friendship. She then went back to her city and we met again a few month later. In this time she also told me that she is in a psych ward because of depression. This hit me really hard and cried a lot. About a month ago we had the chance to meet again. So we did and got close pretty fast. She told me about problems with her boyfriend and that she thinks about leaving him and that she has plans to move in my city. At this point it was clear that we have feelings for each others and spend the few days we had pretty couple like. Most of the initiative came from her because I was still anxious about overstepping any boundaries (she still is in a relationship) and because I'm a shy ass. I haven't felt this good in a really long time. When she went back into her city we still had contact over text for a few days. 
But now she started to ghost me, it's been like this for 3 weeks now. I know that she is going thru a lot recently and that it's really not easy for her but I just don't understand how she can do this to me. Especially because we have been good friends for such a long time now and she was always a really honest person. For the past days I feel like stumbling into double depression. I feel like shit, have zero energy for anything and suicide thought are coming back for the first time in a long time. I don't even know what I want to hear from anyone here but I feel like she shattered me into pieces. I don't know how I should feel about her. She is the only person I ever really felt strong emotions to. I know that if she just cuts me out of her life without a word that this will leave a deep scar and finding a romantic relationship will be even harder than it is for me already.

Please help me,"I just don't have anyone to turn to at this point because my family can't and won't help me and my boyfriend is probably just fed up at this point because there's nothing he can do

My anxiety and depression is to the point right now where all I do if I am not at work is bawl, cry and stress about my life. I work part-time at a corporate bookstore and recently picked up a second job at a smaller, local bookstore. I worked my first shift there yesterday. I'm just so stressed about money and this new job only wants to give me $11 and hour despite me being 21 with full, open availability and a 2-year degree. I'm so bad at being assertive so I just don't know what to do because now I'm working two jobs for almost no money and idk how I'm ever gonna make money. When I told them yesterday I thought I'd need to keep my other job because I didn't wanna take a pay cut my new manager seemed offended and I can't stop thinking about it and stressing it. She told me they'd need to mull over if that would be okay because I ""said a different number in my interview"" even though we barely talked about wages. I said I was hoping for $11.50-$12 at the least but that was all I said and they just started me at $11 and figured that would be fine. My next shift there is on Wednesday. So that whole situation is really stressing me out

I also need to get braces put on next month because my teeth have moved since not having retainers. This is also causing a huge amount of stress for me.

Anyway, enough about rambling about all that. My depression and anxiety are so crippling because I  cannot handle the stress of adulthood life. Like I seriously don't know how to cope. All I do before and after a shift at work is cry. And I'm forced to put on a mask at work like I'm fine when really, I'm so stressed I can't even function properly anymore

Right now I'm under a pile of pillows crying while my boyfriend plays video games in the living room. I feel like soon he will be fed up with me because it seems like this is how every morning goes, lately. I am too stressed to act fine though, like I am constantly panicking and on the verge of bursting into tears so I literally don't know how to calm myself down and I've been like this for weeks

I am seeing a new therapist on the 29th and going to my med doctor on the 30th. I just hopped back on prozac and am hoping this combined with other meds can help. But I hate that I need something like a medication to feel normal. And right now I'm not okay. And I don't know if I ever will be.... I seriously don't know what to do. I love my boyfriend so much and I'm being such an awful girlfriend because I'm so unhappy with where my life is and not content that all I can do is be super anxious about every single work day and cry when I'm not at work.

But everyone asks me, “Why, why would you feel like that?” I don’t know how I’m supposed to respond. I’m currently at the top of my class, am considered on of the leading freshman in our art program, my class’s president, am in a spectacular band program where I get compliments for my performance and improvement daily.

But... I still hate myself. With a passion. And I just want to sleep all day, not go to school or enjoy life. Just sleep, especially with my continued failure with the opposite sex and relationships. I’m constantly told by girls that I’m a great guy, that I’m trustworthy and everything, but then I actually go to make a move, and they just say something along the lines of “I don’t want to risk losing you as a great friend”... 

I just feel like I’m this guy in a world that keeps trying to spare his feelings, a guy that gets told all these great things even though, in actuality, he’s just a pathetic little nerd that can’t compete against anyone else in our society. And I hate myself because of it.",1579969659.0,0.92,4
I'm just so fucking tired.,"Where to begin, I moved home last summer because (after paying off $10k of CC Debt and finally being free) I got myself right back in trying to build a ""coaching"" business.

Then in August moved somewhere I thought I'd be able to get a good job and get back on my feet. Interviewed a few places, but none of them hired me.

Got assaulted by a friend of a friend and had to go to the ER (now have a $1k medical bill). 

Ended up having a guy live with me who was an ex-convict who didn't pay rent for two months (he always ""lost"" the money) and threatened to beat me up when I said I was kicking him out. Oh, he also invited a woman to come live with us without asking me, and then he beat her up and kicked her out and trashed the place at the end of December...

Had to move home yet again.

Now I'm $25k in debt (a year after finally being debt free), living at home with my parents, unemployed, and I'm turning 29 this year.

I don't know how I'm going to turn this shit around, and I don't know if I even want to. I think about suicide a lot. I know it would crush my parents and my family, but I just can't trust myself to keep making decisions and fucking myself like this for the rest of my life. And at least all my CC and medical debt would be gone if I was gone.

My resume is a dumpster fire, and the thought of working shitty jobs I don't even enjoy or find meaning in for the rest of my adult life sounds like a fate worse than death.",1579969413.0,0.67,0

"Looking back at my childhood, I can't understand why I'm depressed","Loving parents, never once I lacked food, education or even friends. SOmetimes I wonder if there's something really horrible that happened during my childhood and if somehow my brain is blocking this memory from me.

The first time I had sex I was around 9 years. I was groomed by a ""friend"" way older than me and it did involve more than one person over the time. I was made to think it was completely normal thing to do since my parents never talked about these matters with me. Thing is, I don't remember these things in a negative light, I don't feel like I have any kind of trauma, I'm not disgusted or ashamed even though I am straight. I just accepted it and moved on.

&#x200B;

I suffered some bullying too mostly when I was 10-11 years old, but light bullying. Nothing extreme, got in two fights but thats it. They made fun of me but since it happened with everyone I didn't think it was abnormal, more like annoying.

&#x200B;

And here I am, 18 years old and lost. I feel completely empty, unsatisfied with life. I don't feel sad, I just feel empty, like there's no meaning to life. Even when I feel pleasure or when I genuinely smile, the emptiness won't leave me. I don't feel like doing anything, I'm just locked in my room browsing the internet all day amusing myself. It's been like this since I was 10-11 years old. Think a kid that never leaves his room willingly for 8-7 years. The first and last time I tried to kill myself I was 12. I don't freaking remember why I tried to kill myself but I remember how. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, hid it in my bag and instead of going to school I went deep into a nearby forest. I did cut my shirt and pointed the knife to my heart. I tried to stab myself, but couldn't gather enough strength to go all the way in. I was afraid of the pain but still could feel like I wouldn't mind dying.

Lost and hopeless,"Well, I've been a long time sufferer of depression, diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

I've been good in recent history as a consequence of weightlifting. I picked it up in October 2018 and made a real commitment to it, got myself in the best shape I've ever been in, and felt pretty good most of the time.

Then last November I was assaulted. It concluded when I was picked up and body slammed into a glass tabletop. My hand broke in two places when I went through the table.

Being that I drive for a living, I was unable to work for a while. I had have my hand rebroken and surgically corrected after it didn't set properly with a splint.

Just this week I finally got the metal pins out of my hand, and while it still has a ways to go I can go back to work now.

The problem is that I find myself with no tolerance for stress at all. It's like I'm afraid to go back to work. In the time since the assault I've had this problem with lapsing into a fight in my mind... I become so engrossed in it that I compulsively start to fight the air in front of me. I literally swing my fist at nothing...

Once I get that far I think, ""ok that's insane"" and I find the awareness to dial myself down a little, but that doesn't keep it from happening again.

After about 6 weeks of that I finally got a doctor to prescribe me a beta-blocker so I could get a break from my own adrenaline here and there. It was wearing me out.

Now I find myself in the position of being broadly stress reactive, feeling like I can't bear everything I have to do now to put my life back together. I'm flat broke and in debt, my credit score is hosed now, I'm staying with family in a spare room but my welcome here is limited and I've about used it up.

I feel like I'm going to end up living in my car, at least until it gets repo'd. My mind has gone dark again... I thought I had myself above this now.

I keep scrambling frantically to find some way to generate an income online, something within my tolerance for stress. I can't bear the feeling of being on fire, head-to-toe.

Suicide has been presenting itself as an option far too often lately. It's just gone dark for me again...",1579968011.0,0.67,0
Does anyone else project self-hatred onto other mentally ill people? TW: Sanism,"Okay so I can tell right off the bat this is probably gonna be controversial, I've lost friends over mentioning this, but please hear me out as I think it's important that issues such as this get discussed in the mental health community.

I've had mental health problems since a very young age, which festered and grew until my 16th birthday, the day of which I set up an appointment with my GP, who referred me to CAHMS (the NHS' youth mental health service). I had to wait nine months for an appointment, and they prescribed weekly CBT sessions. I asked them to rescedule the appointments because they overlap with my college meaning I'd have to drop out to attend, and they blocked my number.

So now I have all this self-hatred going unchecked, and am simply unable to get help. The system which was meant to help me simply acknowledged me and then threw me out. So if they werent willing to help me, surely my problems aren't that important, right?

And if my mental problems aren't worthy of support, then neither are anyone elses', right? A decade of mental anguish going unchecked, drug abuse and self-harm isn't enough to get even a second look from the system? Then surely people who just feel sad sometimes are just being whiny as well, despite their experiences.

I need advice on how to cope with my abandonment depression I developed after a break-up,"The break-up happened around April 2017. I still had to see my ex boyfriend everyday until November 2018 as we had classes together. Everyday was triggering for me. I had PTSD like responses to seeing him. It finally started getting better in 2019 as I no longer had to see him. I was still incredibly anxious about running into him on campus, social place, or interacting with him in our mutual friendship circle. 

Fast-forward to this year, he has moved to the city I was planning on moving to. I have noticed he copies my actions, which might explain his move as he knew I was moving there and started looking for a position in that city.

I am absolutely terrified I run into him when I move there. It is a big move too as it's to another country and I won't have my support network. 

I really need constructive advice on how to deal with this as I am currently in a very depressed state after finding out this information.

i don’t have much hope left.,"alright so because i’ve been feeling very depressed for a long time now, i decided to go see a psychologist. people say to reach out if you are feeling suicidal or upset because this will for sure 100% help you feel better, right? yeah that’s what i thought too, but plot twist - therapy (or whatever you call it) didn’t help me at all. (i went there for around 2-3 months, if anyone’s interested). i know that’s not the psychologist’s fault, i’m sure it’s my fault that i can’t get better.
right now i feel probably even more suicidal and depressed than before somehow. and if therapy didn’t help me, then nothing, besides ending everything, will help, right? tbh i feel very hopeless at this point. like wtf is wrong with me and why can everyone else get better, but not me. i fr don’t think i have enough energy to keep going thru this crap.",1579967658.0,1.0,1
I have issues,"I’m a lonley ass person who’s insecure, cant properly talk to people, restless for hours every night, and im starting to get angry at myself for being such a fucking failure.

This is a massive wall of text but I’d appreciate someone to read it... :( Anyone to chat to about my feelings would be lovely.,"I’ll give you a recap on me before I tell you about last night and how I’m feeling.  

Before on this subreddit I’ve told you all how I’ve been depressed for 8 years and recently after my breakup with my boyfriend, moving home and finding out I have attachment disorder I’ve been at rock bottom.  I have started seeing a counsellor weekly which does help me, but progress is slow and it doesn’t ease the pain of being alone in my room every night at the moment.  I struggle with keeping friendships and I have one close friend who I’ve managed to keep since school but she goes to university about 2 hours away now; she’s in her third year and we don’t see each other much.  We have e a great laugh when we see each other but we’re not really good at talking and she is unreliable in the way of being someone to physically see or emotional support.  When my friend moves to uni she got me into recreational drugs (including: weed, pills, MDMA and ketamine). I only took the harder things when I went out and me and my boyfriend smoked weed a few times a week when we lived together from April last year to November). I wouldn’t say I was addicted, I have my head screwed on but what started out as an occasional thing definitely became more common when I lived in the flat with my boyfriend.  We would smoke weed everyday and take pills and ketamine on average Friday Saturday Sunday.  At the time I knew we were doing it way to much, it just enabled me to ignore all the other shit I had going on in my head.  I’ve stopped the hard drugs now and smoke weed maybe once every two weeks.  (I just thought I’d give you the whole story because why not). 

So anyway back to last night - my friend was home from university and she said come over we will smoke a joint and spend the evening together.  (If you’d read my other posts you will know I’ve been really secluded and yearn to be around people so I was really excited to see my friend).  When I got there after a 1 hour drive to her nans house where she lives she said we will smoke and then she expected me to drive home later because she was seeing a boy when he finished work at 12.  (My friend has her own problems with family and boys)...but I thought this evening was going to be for me and her and if we were smoking I didn’t really fancy driving home.  My friend is quite stubborn and at this point I knew she was gonna do what she wanted to do (see the boy) so I just thought I would just try to enjoy the evening.  We smoked a joint, went to the pub, had three ciders and we had a good time.  I fancied going out dancing mostly because my pain is eased when I’m around people and I get sad and lonely when I go home and sit on my own.  So while I was at the pub I messaged an old lot of ‘friends’ (I use that term lightly) to see if they were out.  They told me they were out not at their usual place but in the town between my friends house and where I live and I could meet them if I wanted.  The reason I use the term friends lightly is because me and this group never message and this is the group of friends that me and my ex boyfriend would hang around with when we used to go out.  In the group there are two brothers, they’re quite rough and fight other people a lot.  One sells cocaine as well but they’re always lovely and welcoming to me so I’m polite back and mind my own business.  I drove my car to a car park near the club and went in, I had a lovely time and danced the night away.  I usually speak to the brother that doesn’t sell drugs (I’ll call him jack) as we really get on and I had never really spoken to the other one (I’ll call him Harry).  But last night I was having a conversation with Harry and he was just as lovely as his other brother underneath the ‘hard man’ facade, and he informed me that his other brother fancied me.  I’m really not interested in boys right now because I’m still madly in love with my ex and it’s so fresh in my heart.  So I carried on with my night then at the end me and harry were still talking and we didn’t realise the others left so we went to my car and smoked another joint... we thought why not and he came back to mine.  I didn’t have sexual feelings at all but I admit it was nice to cuddle someone (we were fully clothed on top of my bed and mostly chatted).  That’s all that happened and then this morning he tried to undo my jeans and I explained how I don’t want to because I know I’m in love with someone else and it would upset me and he was very respectful and stopped straight away.  I took him home today but as soon as he got out my car I burst out crying because I miss my ex boyfriend so much and I have so many mixed feelings. I hope Harry isn’t upset that’s his brother came to mine, we didn’t sleep together and it’s not that deep but that ran through my mind.  I know that my ex went out last night too and that’s on my mind.

"Have everything, but still feel lost/lonely/meaningless overall?","(cross posted from r/lonely, I'm not sure where to put it)

I'm incredibly grateful for what I have in life.

Great job. Good house. Health. Not too toxic family. Wonderful loving spouse. Relative comfort.

But I'm unable to connect on a deeper level with many. And as far as depression/anxiety, it's always looming just above the surface, but some days are tragically worst than others in regards to feeling utterly empty, lost and alone. Life just seems so pointless most times.

I also feel like I made choices with my life in order to ensure my loving relationship was preserved as best as possible. Now I regret not making different decisions, and I'm angry at myself for not putting myself first. I compromised maybe a bit too far to ensure relationship happiness. His life would change significantly if I weren't in it, but mine would be drastically different because we're fundamentally different people. I compromised on certain values for us, but he wouldn't even think to do that. I wouldn't ask him to, either, and no one trusted my arm. I just thought our love was worth it.

I think I cheated myself a bit now. I'm not seeing an incredibly exciting life together (though loving), and knows I still need to live a separate life just for my own fulfillment. 

But back to my question:

My dad threw my Father's Day gift in my face.,"I had a memory resurface. I was about 6 or 7. My mom and I went to kmart (early 80s) and she let me pick out a Father's Day present.

I'm starting to see my depression and negative thoughts differently.,"I had a rather long positive streak for about 3 months at the start of college. By the end of the semester I failed, but not due to depression like usual, just general life stuff.  My positive streak ended around new years when i saw some of my old friends. Negative thoughts and behaviors are hyper contagious after all. I thought I'd be able to return to normal once I came back but my insecurities about myself cripple my mental state. My physical limitations, my relative attractiveness, my worth not to myself but others.

My heart is where I should have understand or apply the specific knowledge from myriads of things I've learned along the years, yet my brain is just too tired. How do you feel when you know that you've been doing things wrong all your life, and that your ""unique"" learning method is undesirable or even maladaptive? There's a ""big"" test several days from now, and I don't care anymore. God, Baphomet, or anyone, please help me.",1579963244.0,0.67,3
Smiling through Depression,"The other day, I went into a couple of job interviews. One comment in an interview really struck a chord with me. They said 'you sure have personality - most people who come in here tend to hold back'.

Afterwards, I kept replaying the interviews over in my head. I made them laugh, was cheerful and got invited back for round 2 interviews. Have I perfected a mask?

I've been jobless for the last 4 months - last year I was at the lowest point in my life, even though I was at the highest point in my career. Only a few know I lost that job, but no one knows it was because of my depression.

On the outside, I appear confident, cheerful and you'll often find me smiling. I come across like everything is okay, but no one knows on the inside, I am suffering.

This made me wonder how common it is for people to smile through depression, that it led me to search online. Last year, I made an effort to start being kinder to others, but what I wasn't doing was being kind to myself.

Here's a video I stumbled across, it really resonated with me and I wanted to share it. Things aren't always what they seem.

I think very deeply about life and it makes me more depressed and I fear it will continue to make it worse.,"Recently, I am often thinking about if life is really real, and if it is just a test to see if I go to Heaven or Hell.

Just got hit with the old one-two. Why even look for help?,"""I've been relatively depressed recently as well.""

No, you don't understand. I feel empty. There's no more enjoyment to be found in anything. Happiness is fleeting and I am beginning to doubt that there will be a time when I will feel better. I feel like nobody likes me anymore. 

I don't want to die, I just want to get relief, but lately the will just tapers off, man. I'm hoping my next incoming therapy will fix my shit or I'll pull the plug one day.

I am ugly and that’s why I’m depressed for years,"I am ugly, I been told by boys when I was 12 that my 10 year old sister looked better than me. When I was a kid boys would make fun of my head and say it was too round. My dad said I had a block head and called me “Charlotte brown” lol. A person I thought was a friend said I had an upside egg for a  head shape. In middle school I had mild acne and in high school that caused me mental distress and depression and I was a total out cast and bullied because I was short and had acne and was ugly, one guy liked me in high school and I was surprised he even did, I became so shy and introverted to the point I didn’t respond and want to talk anymore, after high school I begun to lose friends and now I don’t even leave the house, random strangers will tell me I am pretty sometimes and one time 3 guys hit on me in one day walking to uni however I didn’t believe them, now I have cousins that use to call me ugly say I am pretty and my skin looks good but I still feel horrible and don’t believe them, I want to die everyday I’m suicidal it doesn’t get better these thoughts are killing me, my younger sister has all the friends and she’s pretty. I never thought of suicide in my teen years however,  I do now that I am in my twenties. I have a weak chin, no jaw, bad damaged skin, chubby cheeks and no bone structure, big long nose that isn’t proportion to my head, and still a round head, a lip too big for the top lip, I’m depressed and even planning to end it, psychiatric help won’t save me I’m done living like this, I didn’t ask to be born. Sometimes I do think well maybe when I graduate college I can get a better job and save for orthogantic  surgery, a chin implant, and a nose job but I’m so depressed, and cheek enhancement.

Exasperation,"I've been diagnosed as clinically depressed. I've been in treatment. Through hard work and with help and support I made changes in my life. Strides towards being content. Which then served as a launching point for being happy. After all, happy is temporary. Happiness all the time is an unrealistic goal. Contentment can be permanent. It serves as the platform, or plateau, from which to reach that peak of happiness. 

Life consists of peaks and valleys. Ups, downs, stagnation, progress, regression, rinse and repeat. If you have made the right decisions and set yourself up for success then you've put yourself in a place where those valleys aren't so deep. And as such those peaks are easier to find again. Not so long ago, just a few short years ago in fact, I found myself in this position. So I know it's attainable. Yet here I am; In a valley that seems deeper than usual. Looking up, it seems so far to reach the plateau. Let alone the peak. I had hoped with all my being that I would never be here again.

Being Mindful: how do you do it?,"It's all I've been hearing about for the past few years. I get that it's important. It's good to be self-aware, to think before you act and speak, to grow your ability for empathy, etc., etc.  

My issue is with the techniques that are recommended. Journalling, taking quiet walks, meditating.... I mean, I can do those things, but it's SO. BORING. And maybe that's just me needing to learn to slow down. Do I just need to keep practicing until it becomes more comfortable? I tend to keep myself in a state of constant distraction. I'm always playing a game, listening to a book, reading an article...anything to keep myself from listening to the thoughts in my head. 

I want to be able to grow as a person and heal my mind and soul, and I think getting to know myself better could be a big step in the right direction.

Life is pointless,"I don't care if anybody reads this, I just need to let it all out.

I feel like life is pointless. It's just being born, growing up, going to school, getting a job having kids/marry and then just wait till u die. Of course there are those happy moments like going on vacation or a regular 'hangout' with your friends but if that's all life has to offer then I refuse. 

Every morning I get up around 7 with 6 hours of sleep. I'm pretty exhausted most of the time and I'm often late for school. I don't have any close friends, I thought I had one but Idk. I don't have anyone. I don't have a good relationship with mother. I don't talk to them unless it's  school related or something. She prefers my siblings anyways.  She even used to say sometimes that she would wish I was more like her best friends child. I know more parents do this but it kinda hits me. I had someone whom I loved. He was depressed and lonely and I kinda helped him and we went out together but now he got popular and a new girlfriend. I guess I'm just jealous of him just because of his new good life. I just want someone whom I can talk to and hug. I just desperately want to love someone and someone to love me. 

I also don't know what I have to do with my life. I'm at this point in my life where I have to decide in which major I want to study. I have no fucking idea. I don't know what I wanna be when I grow up. I'm 14 right now. The only thing I'm interested in are videogames and outer space. I'm so fascinated by outer space and just the universe. I thought I could maybe be an astronomer. But I have to so certain subjects in school for that and I'm too dumb for those subjects. 

So I don't know if I'm really depressed but what I do know is that I'm losing my will to live. I have these suicidal thoughts every evening/ night. Every evening I'm alone in my room, listening to music and sometimes I cry. I really wanna sleep and never wake up or having the least painful death there is. I think that's the main reason why I don't commit suicide. I'm too afraid of the physical pain.

There is this teacher who is very nice to me and I think she kinda knows that I'm feeling down lately.    I even talked to her more than I talk to my mother. She's a really great math teacher. I look forward to her classes. I don't wanna talk to someone face to face but just over text. I feel more comfortable doing that. Just like what I'm doing now. 

Most people (including my mother) think I'm just being overdramatic. There are people who really have life problems and don't have access to food/water everyday. Maybe I'm just an attention seeker. Idk. I just don't know anymore.",1579959116.0,1.0,1

My accolades as King of the losers.,"Going to start with my personal favorite, number 1: Being a 30 year old virgin. Only ten away from the big 4-0 and my heart swells with pride at the thought. 

2: extremely lazy, no discipline. My (moms) house could be on hoarders and make you sick. 

3: No job, anxiety and alcoholism put an end to that.

4: No skills beyond basic manual labor.

5: Mentally ill with deranged thoughts and random outbursts of vile language.

6: No license or vehicle.

7: Alcoholic pothead 

8: Extreme anxiety and depression. 

9: Never leave the house and I hate most people.

10: Literally 1 friend who is drifting away because he became a well adjusted adult.

11: Chronic masturbater

12: I sleep all day and have suicidal ideations at night.

13: dozen holes in my walls from random anger outburts that I can't fix, surrounded by trash that's up to my door and two broken TVs, (punched)

14: No other human would use my bathroom

15: House roof is coming in and my mom's shower is about to cave in. Plus other neglected repairs I have no power to fix.

16: No family in my life. (except mom)

17: 50 bucks to my name which will be wasted on pot.

18: Wasted my best years on the same job with nothing to show. My only skill I mastered was milking cows. Which will get you about 12 bucks an hour, no health care. (You will get crapped on eventually yes.)

19: Haunted by nightmares of past places and situations. My ex gf often shows up, no sex ever happens or she's with another man. The rest of the day she is stuck in my head.

20: I destroyed everything nice I ever owned and houses literally decay around me.

21: My Uncle had to rent a dumpster to clean the only place I ever lived in by myself. (A studio apartment)

22: I'm about 50 pounds overweight and have a neckbeard. I also rarely shower or brush my teeth.

- Sorry about a list and if I broke any rules or made anyone sick. I suck at this too. Just don't end up like me ok? The terror of losing your mind I wouldn't wish on anybody.

Too stupid for the field I'm in,"I'm doing computer science at university, and have been looking for a summer internship for this year. It's been really hard for me to apply and practice coding questions. I've had a few coding assessments so far but they always leave me very depressed thinking I'm not good enough and questioning why I'm even in the tech field. It also sucks seeing everyone apply and go for interviews and do these assessments with ease, when the slightest things bring me down in my daily life, making it so hard for me to do what should be simple for everyone. I'm clearly not as interested in tech as everyone else, which will probably make it impossible for me to ever get a job due to how competitive it is. But I don't have anything else in mind as a career. I feel really lost and feel that my life has no direction as I don't have much interest in anything.

I just felt like venting here because most people around me don't really understand and just tell me to push myself to do it, and they have a point, but it's just so hard for me to carry on doing it. I really just want to give up since I'll never be employable anyways.",1579958340.0,0.67,0

I need to get this off my chest.,"Its been 5 months since my ex left me.. I dont even know why i care still. I think its because she was keeping me looking up.. Looking forward. She was a great person.

Ive been sitting here crying ever since ive gotten off work.. I just dont know what has changed in me in the past few years.. She told me i was too depressed, that she was too different. I know she was just over me. And i get that i happens.. I always assumed it would eventually happen. But something just felt different, like i had found someone who understood.
Idk.

As a little kid, i used to question how people could kill themseleves.. I didnt know many people personally who had taken their own life.. Maybe my first real experiance where my perspective on it all changed,was when my neighbor across the street from my grandmother killed himself after a long, failed cancer battle... I kinda started to understand.. You dont really want to die... But you sure as fuck dont want to live everyday of your lifw in misery either.. Just waiting to die for it to end... And im not comparing myself to someone with cancer.. But i am really starting to understand just wanting it to stop.

I haven't beem happy in months.. I cant tell you when the last time ive gone more than a few hours without feeling like im about to have a full on mental breakdown or just crying and hoping no one realizes it... I cant tell you how many times my co-workers everyday ask me if im okay.. It just annoys me now... I just want people to stop stating the obvious.

I feel so fucking worthless. And i try to do things that used to make me happy.. Or try new things.. I can make friends.... But i always end up just slumping down into a sad period and blocking everyone out... And i dont want to do that, but i always just feel like i need to be completely alone for a while... Like im just in a game, and everyone else is oblivious to the fact that they are too.

I just want to feel myself again. Its like im the same body, but all my thoughts are just of someone else who died what feels like years ago. I dont like anything about myself anymore.. I always go into these couple week long periods of liking myself.. Where i will work on my body a bit.. And think that i dont look as bad as i say i do.. But it always ends up being fruitfull in the fact that i still dont mentally feel good.

Im no longer crying... I needed the tears to stop so i can go back to sleep.. And i felt the only real way was just to tell someone... I could never tell any of my friends this shit.. I know it would make me sound like a pussy or something... Its just not something i could do.. I'd just end up crying and making them feel super awkward..... Thank you to anyone who read this...

Noticing patterns,"Hey guys, I’ll start off by stating I am undiagnosed but have been dealing with this for 14+ years. Recently I relocated and through a change in routine and keeping myself busy I’ve been able to keep myself in check. Having a few slip ups here and there. But suicidal thoughts and the like have stayed relatively at bay. Which is a big step for me. (No issues though before someone worries, I manage rather well at keep myself in check.)

Last night was my first date since 2014, a rather toxic relationship and an understanding that I needed to work on myself, as well as not burden anyone had kept me out of it for a long time. No hook ups, not hanging out ect. As to not waste anyone’s time. It went incredibly well from both party’s (so I’m told anyways) and I was feeling great. The night prior I had the chance to play my music live for the first time and over a year and had a blast as well. It was honestly a great two days, and had me a little high on life. That’s sorta the issue though.

I’ve started noticing anytime I have a streak of ‘good days’ or just days of feeling optimistic my issues hit like a truck. I’m bad for over thinking, and being pessimistic in general. But it’s alway so much more overwhelming .

I guess what I’m posting about, is does anyone else get these emotional hangovers? Is it just me, and how do you guys manage? I’ve already came close to self sabotaging this potential relationship due to this, and to be honest it’s difficult to reel myself in.",1579955827.0,1.0,3
Depression makes me a lazy selfish person,"Has anyone skipped important events like bdays, catch ups and weddings etc because of their depression?

They’re angry at me but this depression is almost something I can’t control. I feel so shitty that I really want to stay home during this time. 

When I was out recently, I told my colleagues that I felt tired all the time... it’s a cry for help. But it was just ignored because they don’t see anything wrong with it. Why go out when you have to pretend to be normal and happy? 

Nobody gets me. My friends don’t get my suffering. Where are they when I’m in the depths of darkness? I have to go to Reddit because I’m so alone. My psychologist thinks I’m doing fine but I’m not. I want to drink poison, self harm, write my suicide note, and die,

And no, I am not (actively) suicidal, just venting as I am lying awake at 4am - I was finally tired enough to fall asleep at a sensible time for once until my wonderful roommates came back from a Friday night out at midnight and made sure I was bright awake again.

I finally decided to see a therapist again after several years,"32 F.  

I saw a therapist and I am struggling to motivate myself to find another one.  I don't know where to begin.  This one wasn't a good fit and it took a lot of out of me to go and open myself up.  She was a bit rude here and there and judgmental, about odd things.

I could also tell she began to pity me in the way she completely changed after hearing some of my life.  I didn't like that because you should be comforting to people who say they have depression and anxiety, without making them validate that they are worthy of compassion.  Only after hearing some of the worst of my life did she start to be less stand offish.

I didn't want pity.  I wanted positivity and motivation.  

She made some comments I didn't think were professional, and when I mentioned how I wasn't taking one of my new medications yet because I was afraid of the side effects, she rolled her eyes.  I have had bad reactions to medications before, once landing me in the ER, and I have Lupus so sometimes my body reacts to small changes by attacking my immune system.  My doctor understands this, but this woman rolled her eyes at it after knowing me 20 minutes.  

I know my depression is getting worse and I feel like I'm suffocating.  I browsed images of a hundred therapists near me and have no idea who would be a good fit.  How do people find a good therapist?",1579953919.0,1.0,3
Its forgetting what your favourite things feel like,"Depression isn't ony moping in the dark. 

Its the binging of food. 

Of not being able to even brush your own teeth.

 Its not being able to enjoy the things that you once did. 

Its breaking down over even the break of your cup. 

Its staying in bed for absolutely no reason because you simply can't handle being with people. 

Its alcohol binge.

Its playing the same song on repeat.

Its crying in bed at 3am wondering why you feel the way you do.

Depression is a battle that never ends. I wish we had more understanding for those of us going through it instead of telling them to ""stop mopping"" or to ""try to be grateful for what you have.""",1579953754.0,0.6,0
I'm angry and I can't get rid of it,"This past week I’ve been trying to verbally acknowledge my emotions, to make an effort to stop and process them instead of repressing them.

It was going well, I’ve been much more productive than normal, have actually had a clear head and felt fairly normal for a few days straight. But then, a couple of days ago, I had just one irritating incident and now I’m suddenly back to my old self. Only four times as angry.

I’m surly, I’m irritated by every little thing that goes different to how I want it, I’m growling like an animal at every little inconvenience. I’m staring daggers at kids just for being a little loud in the road, at people just for walking a way so I’ll have to maneuver my dog around them.

I’ve tried getting my anger out. The first day it sort of worked. I just felt compelled to smash something after stewing on some racist bullshit my dad pulled and I hit my mattress for a few minutes. I felt better at the end of it, I was actually chuckling in emotional relief because of the sudden, massive swing between rage and calm.

But I tried it again today and it didn’t work. I felt the same, I was just tired and out of breath. I felt like I wanted to scream so I tried screaming into pillows. It just made my throat sore. I feel like that scream is still held in my throat. It’s just air and noise coming out.

I don’t know if it’s my fault, if I’m just acknowledging my emotions wrong. It was a lot easier those first few days I tried it. Now when I try and put names to what I’m feeling, it’s a lot harder, they same a lot more vague or like I have to concentrate more to see them. It felt like the fog had cleared enough for me to see through it to what I’m thinking and feeling, but now it’s back. It feels like I just suddenly forgot the trick to feeling normal right after I just learned it.

I’m still as productive strangely, but it just feels like an empty, cargo cult ritual of what my clearer self was doing. Maybe it’s just momentum, and that’ll go away too.

I really thought I could put it behind me. I really thought my future had finally arrive, after all the waiting and suffering, I spent a week feeling like I actually had a future, planning out what I was going to do the rest of my life now that I felt like I could actually manage it. Then only a few days later I was back to feeling like I’ll probably kill myself in a few years.

I’m going to try and keep this momentum up and keep doing what I was doing and see if I get back there. I hope this a just a blip and they’re part of the process. I could manage blips.",1579953723.0,0.67,0

Reason of my depression part 1,"Here is a story of me that I wrote when I was twelve that continued through the years and got a sequel and has it's part 6 now so... Tell me if you want to know what happened next to Elijah (me) 



Dear Reader

My name is Elijah

Now I'm going to tell you a short story.

A story about a little boy's life.

Lets start

March 26 2004 this boy was born.

And from the complications and problems of his family.

His Grandfather & Grandmother decided to tell his mom 

to KILL the child in her.

His mom replied ""This is my son and this is my problem not yours!""

Then he came to grew a happy life. (Well umm that was not what the reality is)

(Well I'm not gonna open this too much ok!)

So lets skip to the year 2009 when he knew that his mother was married to a old jap guy

She did for her son because she cannot provide anything for him.

So the boy was left alone with his Grandma,Uncle(The brother of his mom),Aunt(the sister of his mom).

Years before...

The Mom,Uncle and Aunt of the boy didn't experience motherly love from his grandma

Back to 2009...

That time the attention of the grandma is always to the boy because he's younger.

Now the Uncle an Aunt got jealous of the boy.

Now they hurt and mostly they order the boy to do things like CLEANING THE ENTIRE HOUSE!

If the boy didn't do it right he'll get PUNISHED!

Even he's almost 6 or 7 years old that time so that time should be around 2010 or 2011

Everyday he always get hurt coz he can't always understand what they were saying..

So everyday of his life was like a routine torture...

One day he fell in love and then instantly he got rejected!

Everytime she approach or talk to a girl they run away.

They called him creep,weirdo and autistic

Even some of his family members called him that!

One day :

The boy woke up late around 12 : 46 in the afternoon

He didn't go to school that day so he realised that he's fucked

So in order to make those older people not angry he must clean the entire house

Later...

The boy whispered to himself

""Finished at last""

Then suddenly...

""Elijah! you didn't go to school today right!""
""Now choose!""

""Get spanked until I become tired or get exiled!""

Because the boy is confused he chose to get exiled.

He didn't know where to go.

Then he decided to go to his father.

Long story short ( His father had taken him and left him in Bulacan province where his grandmother and other relatives were )

There he still mostly got hurt but instead of spanking him with hard materials they punch him

Even not in his old home he still experience PAIN

Then the boy screamed to himself

""no one loves me and no one will ever love me! never!""

""I will not be accepted for who I am and for what I am!""

""Im useless to everyone!

""I should end my life once and for all

Then one day the exact day that he will commit suicide...

By the time the boy was about to kick the chair, his old friend opens the door shouting  :

""YOU DON'T HAVE TO THIS! PLEASE!""

He replied :

""No I have to!""

""I'm too useless to live! and no one loves me!""

The girl said :

""No that's not true!""

""Because I love you! you're important to me! I can't forgive myself if I lose you once more!""


He tears roll down his face and said  :

""Celeste why! why are you doing this?!""

""how can I be so important to you!?""

""how can you even love someone like me!?""

""answer me!""

She cried and said :

""Elijah I love you for who you are and what you are!""

""I love what you do! you make people happy!""

""Like me and Rachel,Selene,Reina and everyone else!""

""We may not seem to but we do love you""

""So please don't do this and let's talk this through""

He embraced her and cried so hard that it made his speech incomprehensible

That day changed his whole life. (Because he believed)

Even he's totally depressed the girl and his friends made 
him happy

Then 6 months later the girl left him because the girl needed to leave the country and go back to her hometown...

And the people around him tell him that the girl was already dead...

THAT was the boy's great downfall...

And the girl who he thinks that would be there by his side left... (He isn't angry or anything, he just can't accept the fact that no one stays forever)

The boy didn't know what to do and he is alone once again 
with his thoughts...

 Sincerely
    Elijah

How to help a depressed person?,"First of all, hello everyone.

Second of all, I truly don't know whether this post belongs here or not. I've looked for some other subreddits but didn't found a good one for this problem. That's why I'm writing this in here.

So, I wanna make things clear first: I, myself, am not despressed but do have a good friend that suffers under depression and great sadness. 

I really want to help her but I just don't know how. It just makes me so uncomfortable and sad seeing her going down like this, because I really see, how this all lets her suffer so much. She's going through a rough time currently and a break-up (her boyfriend broke up with her, not the other way around) and she's under great pressure from so many people. She always tries to make everything fine and perfect for other people and participates in a lot of social activities e.g. she's in the student council at our school but also in a sort of ""student council for our state"" (We live in germany and it's called LSV (Landesschüler*innenvertretung). So, she's a absolute perfectionist and, thou, she suffers under a great pressure. She often writes me when she's crying and asks me for help. She tries to get drunk and often mixes alcohol with painkillers which lets her physical health suffer. And when she asks me for help, I don't know what to respond or to say.

So, what can I do to help her? How can I comfort her in this unpleasant situation? How can I get her to a happier person (even if it lasts only for a few days or maybe hours)? What can I do, so I don't feel this unhelpfull even though I really want to help her with that?",1579949323.0,1.0,7
What’s the point?!,"I’ve got to the stage in my life that I don’t see the point anymore. 

In September 2018 I went to the police about one of the worst things that could have happened, I lost 8 years of my childhood being afraid of this person and now my whole family have taken the side of my abuser, within 10 minutes of being on the phone I lost everyone in my family and all of my friends. The only member of my family I had left was my father. 
At the age of 11 I tried talking my own life, my mother walked in to my room as I was taking tablets and cutting my self and laughed. She walked out and never spoke about it again. After she left I started crying out of control and that caused me to be sick. I went to school the next day thinking about doing it again...

I always got told to go to therapy, the last time I went to see someone I was 16 I tried to explain what had happened to me and I asked for help. The person I’d gone to see then told me to grow up and deal with my shit! 



At the age of 18 I tried to take my life again but this time I had my father there to help me through it. So two trips to hospital and a visit to a mental hospital I’m here now still considering ending it all. 

Nobody understood what I’d been through and I don’t think they ever would. People say to me that I can’t live in the past but how can I not when it took almost half of my life, I walk around my home town and see everyone looking at me and all I can think is do they know? Do they realise I’m in pain? 

I’m so sick of the anxiety I have. But more so I’m sick of the depression. 

Would it be easier if I just ended it?",1579949282.0,1.0,4

My [26F] partner [27M] has depression and he’s taken the first steps to recovery,"My partner I are based very far from one another so we have always lived with one another during our relationship.  We had just spent a lot of time together, in fact we spent 24/7 together, we worked together, showered together, slept together — everything.  We travelled around together.  Then we both stayed at our own homes for 6 weeks. 

When I returned to living with him, I returned to a different person.  The weight was piling on, he wasn’t the “wake up early with energy ready to do anything but stay in bed”, he wasn’t the “let’s exercise” man, he didn’t have the same energy, he didn’t want to do anything, he no longer enjoyed anything. 

I’ve been depressed (my mental illness includes depression) for a very long time, so long I don’t remember time without it except for the fleeting moments I work hard for.  Despite picking up issues with other people, it was hard with my partner, I nearly **forgot** depression existed.  His personality change was obviously my fault, he hated me, he no longer loves me, he’s being irritable, angrier, and he’s someone I want to be away from.  Then he became horribly sick (with a virus), the healthiest person I know is sick.  Not only did it shock me, but it scared me and also made me realise that there was something not okay with everything that had been happening.  We had a big talk after he was mostly better, we both took the necessary steps. 

It’s now nearly a month since my return and yesterday he went for his first run again.  Tonight, he did his first workout.  So many nights were full of frustration and hurt, but I stayed because I knew that I loved him and he was feeling a much bigger hurt.  He deserves love and support.  I want to stick by him no matter what and I will.  My hard work and persistence has paid off — he’s letting himself heal.  

It’s hard when you have a mental illness, then your partner develops a mental illness.  You never hear much about what to do when two people are struggling with life.  I never thought it would happen to me, or him. 

Just a thought.  I’d love to hear anyone else’s stories/advice.",1579948688.0,0.6,1
"Harsh or cruel as it may sound, it seems that depression is your own responsibility","TL;DR: Life life in spite of yourself, and remember that even the tiniest step, is still a step and you should be proud of yourself for taking it.  


As stated in the tile, it sounds harsh and probably is as well. It is understandable and many times necessary to seek the help of others. Others can help you along the way, act as supports in the times you cannot hold yourself up. But at the end of it all, when it comes to your own mind, no matter the time or effort it takes to happen, you are responsible for making the changes, for leading your life in the right direction.

I have been and still remain insecure. I still feel that uncertainty creep up on my back every time someone talks of the future. Even now I feel like I am falling behind every time I see someone I know get a girlfriend, get married or have children.

Of course it is hard to sit there and look at your friends have fun, it is hard to look at the success of others and believe you will get there too when you get to the state of mind that is depression. Sometimes it seems hopeless to even wake up in the morning, it may even feel meaningless. But even when it does, especially when it does actually, it is time to stand up to yourself and defy your own mind.

When your body says stay in bed, you wake up. When your body refuses to sleep and bombards you with thoughts, chase them off and pass out anyways. If you hate your life and wish only for death as you stare into a blade for the seventeenth time that month, you throw that knife into the ground or wall, and tell yourself that death is the end. Death is the end to all things, all good and all bad.

The cliché here is to say that all bad things pass and things will get better, but to be brutally honest with you, it many times doesn’t. Stuck in a rut, feeling pushed into a hole by society and expected to act like a robot for over half your life is horrifying, and when a depressed mind interacts with that mindset, often a person also with little happiness to begin with, giving up becomes the easiest. So easy even, that calling for help doesn’t even cross their minds, an end to it all becomes simply, and conveniently for them, the only answer that they can find.

In a world where people try to blackmail you out of suicide by saying “There are people who care about you” and “Things eventually work out"" or ""These things are temporary"" I want to say that though i do not recommend or hope that anyone ever takes their life. I will never blame or condone anyone for going through with it.

Many people say “Do away with the people that bring negativity to your life” And that is all well and good, but it doesn’t really help when sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. continually bombards you with pictures of the life of others.  
In today’s age, you are exposed to the life of others far too often, every day you see someone having fun or hanging out with friends or something. Even when you complain about this other people say ""They aren't as happy as they look, they only want to look happy to the world"" And that too is fine, but it is still exposure, and ends up influencing you.  
If i were to pick one thing that was better before the information age, it is that people were exposed to so much less or other's lives, giving less opportunity to compare. In my opinion, overexposure is among many others, the biggest reason behind my depression.

As stated I am still depressed to this day, and struggle with doubts, thoughts that keep me awake in the night, and sometimes have difficulty doing the simplest things due to me having no confidence and low self esteem at the same time.  
But I have figured out a small way that works for me, it is nothing revolutionary, nor is it anything new, it is simply how I have convinced myself to live, how I continue to cope with life until maybe one day I can return to society as a non depressed regular person.

I still visit all those social sites daily, I still watch Youtubers a thousand times richer than I’ll probably ever be. There are still people bragging about their new cars or something somewhere. Even those people posting motivational things have ended up being a point of frustration for me.  
But I made a single change, not one that removed or solved anything, it simply tweaked my perspective enough to begin turning things around.

I couldn’t stop comparing myself to others, I wasn’t able to just let go of wanting to become famous, or have at least a couple friends I can truly have fun with again. I simply accepted that I may or may not be these things. I may become famous, I may have more friends, I may even be normal again some day, but then again, maybe I won't.  
I do not hope for these things, nor do I claim any grand ambition or goal as my own. Every day I take a small step, every day I write a page in the word document I hope one day will become my book. I stopped thinking of my book as a whole, I kept thinking of events hundreds of pages away, I kept wresting endings with everything and tried to tie everything together without ever being able to start the damn story.

I realize that having a goal or ambition is great, but not necessarily for someone like me. If I had to choose, the my 'grand' ambition every day is write a single page, or correct the two last pages I wrote every day, that is all.  
It sounds stupid to me, “I want to write at least one page a day” but after thinking about it, if I sometimes do two, occasionally do thee or rarely do three and more, then imagine how many pages that becomes, if I strive and continue doing this, it can become a minimum of 30 pages a month, up to a potential hundreds depending, but realistically around 20 to 75 a month. Continuing like this, then the formerly far off goal of this ‘epic’ story seeing the light of day seems just a year or two away.

That brings me to time, a concept that brings fear to any mortal being. The thing is, things take time, and though time is indeed limited, there is a lot of it.  
 I too thought “Damn that is too few” when I heard that a hundred years is only Eight hundred and seventy six thousand hours, one third of which we spend sleeping. But stop yourself if that’s what you are thinking, for it is not the amount of time we are going to be worried about. Stop worrying about time left, instead focus on how to spend that time.  

Some people set up schedules. Some have routines and get by that way. You also have people like me who sort of wing it. I go to sleep between eleven and midnight, and wake up all between five and eight the next morning, depending on how I feel. My one rule for sleeping is always not to sleep past ten.

I then do the usual stuff, toilet, eat, and hang around watching some YouTube or twitch. Then sometime  around an hour or so after I wake up, maybe two depending, I sit down and get this uncomfortable feeling in my shoulders and gut as I open that word document. This is my body pushing me back, my doubts and inner sloth craves nothing else than to lie down, relax, waste my life away and turn to greatly unimpressive dust one day. What many call this feeling is resistance, I have come to call it my own ego or selfishness. We are all programmed to take the easy path when offered, and as I have been a stay at home for a while now, that is what I’ve been doing. Realizing this however, and the fact that I hate myself, I decided to start liking myself a little if only to spite myself, I write a page a day not to feel accomplished, but to prove to myself that I am able to win against my own mind. Though I still lose that battle at times, I go into the next fully prepared to win.

You are your own best friend, but you are also your own worst enemy. Like yourself or hate yourself, low or high self esteem and confidence. These are all traits we carry.  
 I understand it may be scary, but continue doing things in spite of yourself. Don’t like talking to people? Just say hi to someone once every time you go out and smile to them. Hate making meals, once a week make something more elaborate than usual, like if you usually have microwaved meals for every meal, take it easy and fry up some bacon and eggs with toasted bread or something. If you usually make bacon and eggs for breakfast, take the time to add to it, put some salad in there, maybe fry some onions for it, and just for the hell of it, if you have a friend you know is a hungry beast, make enough for two and get them to come over. Don’t worry about taste, they get it for free so they should be grateful you aren’t serving them coal and extra coal bits with magma as sauce.

Also remember that sometimes, losing a battle isn’t so bad. Maybe allow yourself a loss at times, so that you can be stronger for tomorrow. Challenge yourself, exert yourself and if nothing else, just try. At the end of the day, whether you did a little thing, or something big, then clap yourself on the back, literally do it and tell yourself “You did a good job today. You are good enough. You are strong” It may sound stupid, and even looks a bit weird, but I promise you, continue doing it, and continue saying it, and it will at least serve as a small foundation upon which you can build yourself up from.

That became much longer than I thought. I ended up rambling a lot and just writing what came to mind, I still do actually. Compared to my actual writing though, I won’t rewrite or spell check anything. I want everything that is written here to be exactly as it was in the moment, errors and all.

With that said, I am a slightly less depressed dude that thought maybe this would be of use to even one person. Sorry for presuming, and please have a good day. Maybe I should tell people to have a bad day, so that they can have a good day just to spite me? That would be quite some reverse psychology.

I just wanted to say, this is something I wrote on a whim, and just wanted to share... so if you decide to comment, please keep it civil.  
Also if I don't respond to potential comments, it just means I've dug myself in the hole of my home again and hid from public view.  


Living, even if just to spite death

My First Post,"I'm 14 years old and I've been out of school for over half a year. I don't really remember much of anything anymore, I don't remember the last time I've spoken to someone nor do I remember the last friend I had. I don't feel anything really, I laugh and I smile but it's half-hearted. No-one seems to notice, when they ask me if I'm okay I say ""I'm fine"". I went to see a therapist around two years ago and he said it was my fault for feeling this way, feelings of anger, anxiety and emptiness. Whether I'm witnessing people with others I for some reason feel a cold breeze in my chest or something like that, I don't really know how to describe it. I think quite often of not existing. I like sunsets, stars and clouds, whether I'm looking at the sky like that, I wish I could go there...whatever there is. I wonder what it was like being 'normal', it's been so long I forgot. The reason I keep 'living' is because of hope that I will find someone to share life with, a life where maybe I don't feel like this. I know it's naive but I'm still just a kid fortunately or unfortunately.",1579948109.0,0.97,9
Life feels like escapism,"Is it just me...?

It's as if my default state is depression, feeling low or nothing at all, being stuck in a series of repetitive activities every day. It feels like everything I do is just escapism, distracting myself from the constant rumination in my head. Studying, working, watching shows, playing games, talking to people, whatever.

I don't know but it just feels like I'm stuck in this constant state of escapism..",1579947736.0,0.9,3
I'm just numb now,"It's got to a point where I'm numb and used to the shitty emotions I go through. It sort of hit me last night, I thought I knew quite a bit about a certain subject that I love, until someone questioned me about it and I didn't have a clue what to respond with. It made me look a fool, especially in front of a girl who is really cool. I feel like starting a new life. Move somewhere else, forget everything. Start over again, you know?",1579947673.0,1.0,2
Anytime there is a world ending calamity i am really very happy.,"This new Coronavirus has me super exicted and feel like a rush holy shit finally the world is ending hell yeah fi fucking nally it ends. It's only disappointing to know sadly everything will be the same.

Before there was a virus in my country india from bats called nipah i even wanted to go to the state but could not drag my pathetic ass.

End of the world is soothing and calming thinking about dying even suicide sends butterflies through my stomach.

I don't take joy in wars,torture or plane crashes i hate that they happen but natural disasters or things like killer virus wiping out 95% humanity sounds crazy energtic although the thought of getting nuked isn't all that bad.

As soon as my family approaches me it back to yelling and screaming about how i fucked up how i will be homeless begging  and blah blah honestly world end is nice compared to that.End of my miserable life is so calming it's like extreme excitment not exactly the healthiest thougts to have but nobody cares.",1579947671.0,0.77,16

Why the fuck am I hurt?,"So I’m not good at introductions so I’ll just get right into it. I’ve liked my best friend for the better part of two years and she knows it. When she got a boyfriend I was extremely toxic and she understandably got fed up with it and we took a break from talking. We repaired our relationship and it was good until tonight, she started hanging out with one of her coworkers and talking to me less so I suspected that she had feelings for him, and I was right. She knows I like her which is why she didn’t want to tell me, and I really want them to be happy. But I’m so hurt at the same time. I started cutting again and it’s worse than ever before, my chest has been heavy and my vision has been pulsing for the past four hours when she told me. I don’t have anyone to turn to since she’s the only I talk about my emotions with. I have my counselor but he doesn’t have time in his schedule before my wisdom teeth get removed so I’m shit outta luck there. I guess I’m not really asking for help just ranting because I physically can’t cry, but I digress. Thanks for taking the time to read this, sorry that there’s no real question.",1579947617.0,1.0,1

I'm done fighting.,"(I struggle with bpd, anxiety, depression, and ptsd.)

God. I really want to die. I can never tell if I'm happy anymore. I'm convinced everyone hates me despite their attempts at helping me. I feel like such a burden, to everyone.

My relationship doesn't feel stable right now because I couldn't handle his feelings. I feel awful even though I know he understands. Feeling this way coupled with never thinking I'm enough is heartbreaking. 

I feel weak. I'm unable to cope with simple emotions that would barely affect me a couple months ago. Normal people know how to deal with simple problems, why am I struggling?

I have tons of family and friends who are trying to help me, but none of it feels genuine. I go back and forth in my mind; believing they care and want to help to being convinced I'm stupid for trusting any of them. I've always struggled with this, but it's never been this consistent. 

I barely trust myself anymore. I'm just so tired of fighting myself everyday. Sorry for the rant, if you relate please share <3",1579947403.0,0.84,2
thoughts,"I'm under a lot of stress atm and it makes my depression worse. Yesterday and the day before it got extremly bad and i had constant panic attacks . I called my mum and my sister, talking to them always helps. But i feel sooo guilty because I dont want to put that burden on them, too. No mother should hear their child crying like this. I kept saying sorry over and over again. How do you deal with the guilt of being sick?

Fuck you,"I thought I had a good group of friends, one of them backstabbed me and told a shit ton of people I sent them nude photos (I didn’t), and then another friend countinued to hangout with that person, but that’s my choice so I didn’t really get mad at them. Until they said I couldn’t be trusted, someone that I had been friends with for 4 years just turned around and stopped talking to me, it’s like all that fucking effort and pointless time spent is just poof gone. This shit feels awful and I just feel guilty 24/7, I can’t focus on jack shit because it feels like I’m being clawed open from the inside and it feels like I no longer am able to trust anybody so I just keep everything to myself.",1579946568.0,1.0,0
"Don't get help, just pray","No offense for those doing prayer, in my case this doesn't work and I'm looking for alternative.

Just had a convo with my father, I was just venting that things are getting worse and I needed help from professional yet his response is what you need is more prayer but I explained on my case it doesn't work I guess I need to get therapy or meds. He just stayed silent and went on doing stuff. 

I'm just disappointed of my parents instead of encouraging me to get help they just brushed it of like something of a mild headache of some sorts. Btw I grew up on a religious family, until 2-3 years ago I came to realize that faith in deities or God doesn't go with my inquisitive mind asking for evidence/reason, maybe I have read enough science articles and got bad rep on the church I belonged to and also fb groups I joined that focus on science pointing the silliness of theistic belief and their hypocrisy. Also I was suspecting of having depression and anxiety for 2-3 year ago or longer but I need to confirm it with a psychologist/psychiatrist.

I dunno somewhat religion fills a void in my life  of the struggles and anxiety in the past but it doesn't fit to my way of thinking currently. I'm no genius or something just an average guy, non achievers. 

There are times I wanted to get help but when there's a good time to do that I couldn't, I just need someone to force me to seek help or encourage me to do so.

How do you stop hating yourself?,"I hate feeling like I'm useless and disappointing everyone around me. I hate feeling like I've achieved absolutely nothing (I'm 27) whilst so many other people around me have done a lot. I'm unemployed, and working on my second degree because my first one got me nowhere. I don't have a car because I can't afford it, and I unfortunately live at home. I don't have any friends either because I find it difficult to get on with other people.

I grew up in a good family. My relatives are fine too (though maybe a little competitive). I feel like I don't ha the right to complain or be sad about anything because I'm fortunate to have what I have. But I can't fight off that feeling off being a total failure at life. It doesn't help that when I feel very frustrated, I tend to cry easily (and I'm really embarrassed by it) and that only makes me feel even worse. Which of course doesn't bode well for when I eventually graduate to become a teacher.

Recently, I did something stupid (accidentally knocking over a glass of water onto my laptop keyboard and now it's fried) and I've convinced myself I don't deserve another laptop because I'll probably just screw up again. When people are nice to me, I don't believe them and think they're making fun of me. I'm learning how to drive, and every time I do some silly mistake, I beat myself up mentally over it for hours.

How do you stop hating yourself? I want to stop having an immense fear of failure, but it always comes back.",1579945905.0,0.91,2

How to find a therapist,"I’m a broke university student and have been feeling extremely sad for around 3 years now. At  this point I really don’t enjoy doing anything anymore and lay in bed most of my free time. I also  destroyed most of the relationships I had with my previous close friends and when I talk to them now, I feel terrible about myself. I have some friends now luckily, but nothing feels fulfilling and I can’t help but compare them to my old ones. I don’t even know what to do or what to think, or even if I have depression or not.

Enough of that, the problem is that I realize it’s probably time to seek help since I am not enjoying life at all anymore and it’s a struggle just to function. 1. I don’t have the money for a therapist and also I am too ashamed and don’t want my parents to know about this. I don’t want them to worry about me more. I am just not comfortable telling them.

Teens thinking mental illness is 'trendy',"Little rant here, sorry.

I go to a public high school and although there are many worse places in the world, this is one of the worst for me. I'm severely depressed, suffer from eating disorders, suicidal thoughts, anxiety etc. But I've never really complained to anyone apart from here on reddit where no one even reads my posts.

On the two days out of five I actually manage to get myself to school I hear from everyone how ""omg miss is here I high-key wanna kill myself!"" and ""god I can't do pe my anxiety is crazy wish I didn't have to eat"" and so much more. I wish these people knew what it was actually like. Now I know for some they do and I wish I could help them but I'm sick of hearing from them how they have ocd because they hate crooked photos. Do they know how I'm going bald and I'm not even an adult because I pull all my hair out because I have an obsessive compulsive disorder? Or how when they pick at me because I never go to school it's because I was up all night contemplating whether or not to kill myself? Or how when they laugh that I'm never at school yet I get straight As is because my anxiety keeps me up until I've learnt everything I possibly can? 

A group of girls in my class once were crying the whole period once saying how they want to self harm so bad, so they took scissors from their pencil cases and started scratching their arms. I had to go outside because I couldn't take it (it was triggering me). Then after class I was verbally abused because apparently I left and called them attention seekers and they said I don't understand what it's like to cut. Well thank you Chloe but I'm pretty sure underneath my shirt and pants tells a different story but okay.

The same group will constantly talk of how they wish they were anorexic so they weren't so fat. I can definitely say these girls are so beautiful, I've complemented them so many times. And I know it's hard I hope they aren't struggling but they call me anorexic behind my back like I'm a pest. So for some reason they want anorexia yet I who is suffering from bulimia and anorexia is disgusting and attention seeking. 

Please don't read this and think I'm angry at them. I'm really not, if any of them are struggling I'd do anything to take that pain away and give it to myself instead. I just don't understand how they self diagnose and want these illnesses but see I who is struggling and apparently I'm the attention seeker.

Another situation was when this girl I had known since the beginning of school kept telling everyone how she is beaten at home and was raped once. Instantly I felt horrible because I know what it's like to live in that environment and I know how it feels to be sexually violated. But when I went to support her a few weeks later when the fuss died down I was told that she was just mucking around. I've never felt so angry in my life, how could someone joke about that?. 

I just wish people were more understanding and knew that sometimes a joke to them is a reality to others. Sorry.",1579945388.0,0.83,20

Haven't felt that lonely an unwanted since elementary school, when my ""friends"" told me i was annoying and should just fucking leave them alone already.
